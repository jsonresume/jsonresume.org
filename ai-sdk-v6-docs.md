Before we dive in, let's look at what RAG is, and why we would want to use it.

### What is RAG?

RAG stands for retrieval augmented generation. In simple terms, RAG is the process of providing a Large Language Model (LLM) with specific information relevant to the prompt.

### Why is RAG important?

While LLMs are powerful, the information they can reason on is restricted to the data they were trained on. This problem becomes apparent when asking an LLM for information outside of their training data, like proprietary data or common knowledge that has occurred after the model’s training cutoff. RAG solves this problem by fetching information relevant to the prompt and then passing that to the model as context.

To illustrate with a basic example, imagine asking the model for your favorite food:

```txt
**input**
What is my favorite food?

**generation**
I don't have access to personal information about individuals, including their
favorite foods.
```

Not surprisingly, the model doesn’t know. But imagine, alongside your prompt, the model received some extra context:

```txt
**input**
Respond to the user's prompt using only the provided context.
user prompt: 'What is my favorite food?'
context: user loves chicken nuggets

**generation**
Your favorite food is chicken nuggets!
```

Just like that, you have augmented the model’s generation by providing relevant information to the query. Assuming the model has the appropriate information, it is now highly likely to return an accurate response to the users query. But how does it retrieve the relevant information? The answer relies on a concept called embedding.

<Note>
  You could fetch any context for your RAG application (eg. Google search).
  Embeddings and Vector Databases are just a specific retrieval approach to
  achieve semantic search.
</Note>

### Embedding

[Embeddings](/docs/ai-sdk-core/embeddings) are a way to represent words, phrases, or images as vectors in a high-dimensional space. In this space, similar words are close to each other, and the distance between words can be used to measure their similarity.

In practice, this means that if you embedded the words `cat` and `dog`, you would expect them to be plotted close to each other in vector space. The process of calculating the similarity between two vectors is called ‘cosine similarity’ where a value of 1 would indicate high similarity and a value of -1 would indicate high opposition.

<Note>
  Don’t worry if this seems complicated. a high level understanding is all you
  need to get started! For a more in-depth introduction to embeddings, check out
  [this guide](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/).
</Note>

As mentioned above, embeddings are a way to represent the semantic meaning of **words and phrases**. The implication here is that the larger the input to your embedding, the lower quality the embedding will be. So how would you approach embedding content longer than a simple phrase?

### Chunking

Chunking refers to the process of breaking down a particular source material into smaller pieces. There are many different approaches to chunking and it’s worth experimenting as the most effective approach can differ by use case. A simple and common approach to chunking (and what you will be using in this guide) is separating written content by sentences.

Once your source material is appropriately chunked, you can embed each one and then store the embedding and the chunk together in a database. Embeddings can be stored in any database that supports vectors. For this tutorial, you will be using [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) alongside the [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) plugin.

### All Together Now

Combining all of this together, RAG is the process of enabling the model to respond with information outside of it’s training data by embedding a users query, retrieving the relevant source material (chunks) with the highest semantic similarity, and then passing them alongside the initial query as context. Going back to the example where you ask the model for your favorite food, the prompt preparation process would look like this.

<MDXImage
  srcLight="/images/rag-guide-2.png"
  srcDark="/images/rag-guide-2-dark.png"

  height={800}
/>

By passing the appropriate context and refining the model’s objective, you are able to fully leverage its strengths as a reasoning machine.

Onto the project!

## Project Setup

In this project, you will build a agent that will only respond with information that it has within its knowledge base. The agent will be able to both store and retrieve information. This project has many interesting use cases from customer support through to building your own second brain!

This project will use the following stack:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) 14 (App Router)
- [ AI SDK ](/docs)
- [ Vercel AI Gateway ](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/ai-gateway)
- [ Drizzle ORM ](https://orm.drizzle.team)
- [ Postgres ](https://www.postgresql.org/) with [ pgvector ](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector)
- [ shadcn-ui ](https://ui.shadcn.com) and [ TailwindCSS ](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling

### Clone Repo

To reduce the scope of this guide, you will be starting with a [repository](https://github.com/vercel/ai-sdk-rag-starter) that already has a few things set up for you:

- Drizzle ORM (`lib/db`) including an initial migration and a script to migrate (`db:migrate`)
- a basic schema for the `resources` table (this will be for source material)
- a Server Action for creating a `resource`

To get started, clone the starter repository with the following command:

<Snippet
text={[
'git clone https://github.com/vercel/ai-sdk-rag-starter',
'cd ai-sdk-rag-starter',
]}
/>

First things first, run the following command to install the project’s dependencies:

<Snippet text="pnpm install" />

### Create Database

You will need a Postgres database to complete this tutorial. If you don't have Postgres setup on your local machine you can:

- Create a free Postgres database with Vercel (recommended - see instructions below); or
- Follow [this guide](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/postgresql/setting-up-a-local-postgresql-database) to set it up locally

#### Setting up Postgres with Vercel

To set up a Postgres instance on your Vercel account:

1. Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and make sure you're logged in
1. Navigate to your team homepage
1. Click on the **Integrations** tab
1. Click **Browse Marketplace**
1. Look for the **Storage** option in the sidebar
1. Select the **Neon** option (recommended, but any other PostgreSQL database provider should work)
1. Click **Install**, then click **Install** again in the top right corner
1. On the "Get Started with Neon" page, click **Create Database** on the right
1. Select your region (e.g., Washington, D.C., U.S. East)
1. Turn off **Auth**
1. Click **Continue**
1. Name your database (you can use the default name or rename it to something like "RagTutorial")
1. Click **Create** in the bottom right corner
1. After seeing "Database created successfully", click **Done**
1. You'll be redirected to your database instance
1. In the Quick Start section, click **Show secrets**
1. Copy the full `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

### Migrate Database

Once you have a Postgres database, you need to add the connection string as an environment secret.

Make a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.

<Snippet text="cp .env.example .env" />

Open the new `.env` file. You should see an item called `DATABASE_URL`. Copy in your database connection string after the equals sign.

With that set up, you can now run your first database migration. Run the following command:

<Snippet text="pnpm db:migrate" />

This will first add the `pgvector` extension to your database. Then it will create a new table for your `resources` schema that is defined in `lib/db/schema/resources.ts`. This schema has four columns: `id`, `content`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`.

<Note>
  If you experience an error with the migration, see the [troubleshooting
  section](#troubleshooting-migration-error) below.
</Note>

### Vercel AI Gateway Key

For this guide, you will need a Vercel AI Gateway API key, which gives you access to hundreds of models from different providers with one API key. If you haven't obtained your Vercel AI Gateway API key, you can do so by [signing up](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fai&title=Go+to+AI+Gateway) on the Vercel website.

<Note>
  The AI SDK's Vercel AI Gateway Provider is the default global provider, so you
  can access models using a simple string in the model configuration. If you
  prefer to use a specific provider like OpenAI directly, see the [provider
  management](/docs/ai-sdk-core/provider-management) documentation.
</Note>

Now, open your `.env` file and add your API Gateway key:

```env filename=".env"
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Replace `your-api-key` with your actual Vercel AI Gateway API key.

## Build

Let’s build a quick task list of what needs to be done:

1. Create a table in your database to store embeddings
2. Add logic to chunk and create embeddings when creating resources
3. Create an agent
4. Give the agent tools to query / create resources for it’s knowledge base

### Create Embeddings Table

Currently, your application has one table (`resources`) which has a column (`content`) for storing content. Remember, each `resource` (source material) will have to be chunked, embedded, and then stored. Let’s create a table called `embeddings` to store these chunks.

Create a new file (`lib/db/schema/embeddings.ts`) and add the following code:

```tsx filename="lib/db/schema/embeddings.ts"
import { nanoid } from '@/lib/utils';
import { index, pgTable, text, varchar, vector } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';
import { resources } from './resources';

export const embeddings = pgTable(
  'embeddings',
  {
    id: varchar('id', { length: 191 })
      .primaryKey()
      .$defaultFn(() => nanoid()),
    resourceId: varchar('resource_id', { length: 191 }).references(
      () => resources.id,
      { onDelete: 'cascade' }
    ),
    content: text('content').notNull(),
    embedding: vector('embedding', { dimensions: 1536 }).notNull(),
  },
  (table) => ({
    embeddingIndex: index('embeddingIndex').using(
      'hnsw',
      table.embedding.op('vector_cosine_ops')
    ),
  })
);
```

This table has four columns:

- `id` - unique identifier
- `resourceId` - a foreign key relation to the full source material
- `content` - the plain text chunk
- `embedding` - the vector representation of the plain text chunk

To perform similarity search, you also need to include an index ([HNSW](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector?tab=readme-ov-file#hnsw) or [IVFFlat](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector?tab=readme-ov-file#ivfflat)) on this column for better performance.

To push this change to the database, run the following command:

<Snippet text="pnpm db:push" />

### Add Embedding Logic

Now that you have a table to store embeddings, it’s time to write the logic to create the embeddings.

Create a file with the following command:

<Snippet text="mkdir lib/ai && touch lib/ai/embedding.ts" />

### Generate Chunks

Remember, to create an embedding, you will start with a piece of source material (unknown length), break it down into smaller chunks, embed each chunk, and then save the chunk to the database. Let’s start by creating a function to break the source material into small chunks.

```tsx filename="lib/ai/embedding.ts"
const generateChunks = (input: string): string[] => {
  return input
    .trim()
    .split('.')
    .filter((i) => i !== '');
};
```

This function will take an input string and split it by periods, filtering out any empty items. This will return an array of strings. It is worth experimenting with different chunking techniques in your projects as the best technique will vary.

### Install AI SDK

You will use the AI SDK to create embeddings. This will require two more dependencies, which you can install by running the following command:

<Snippet text="pnpm add ai @ai-sdk/react" />

This will install the [AI SDK](/docs) and the AI SDK's React hooks.

<Note>
  The AI SDK is designed to be a unified interface to interact with any large
  language model. This means that you can change model and providers with just
  one line of code! Learn more about [available providers](/providers) and
  [building custom providers](/providers/community-providers/custom-providers)
  in the [providers](/providers) section.
</Note>

### Generate Embeddings

Let’s add a function to generate embeddings. Copy the following code into your `lib/ai/embedding.ts` file.

```tsx filename="lib/ai/embedding.ts" highlight="1-2,4,13-22"
import { embedMany } from 'ai';

const embeddingModel = 'openai/text-embedding-ada-002';

const generateChunks = (input: string): string[] => {
  return input
    .trim()
    .split('.')
    .filter((i) => i !== '');
};

export const generateEmbeddings = async (
  value: string
): Promise<Array<{ embedding: number[]; content: string }>> => {
  const chunks = generateChunks(value);
  const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
    model: embeddingModel,
    values: chunks,
  });
  return embeddings.map((e, i) => ({ content: chunks[i], embedding: e }));
};
```

In this code, you first define the model you want to use for the embeddings. In this example, you are using OpenAI’s `text-embedding-ada-002` embedding model.

Next, you create an asynchronous function called `generateEmbeddings`. This function will take in the source material (`value`) as an input and return a promise of an array of objects, each containing an embedding and content. Within the function, you first generate chunks for the input. Then, you pass those chunks to the [`embedMany`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/embed-many) function imported from the AI SDK which will return embeddings of the chunks you passed in. Finally, you map over and return the embeddings in a format that is ready to save in the database.

### Update Server Action

Open the file at `lib/actions/resources.ts`. This file has one function, `createResource`, which, as the name implies, allows you to create a resource.

```tsx filename="lib/actions/resources.ts"
'use server';

import {
  NewResourceParams,
  insertResourceSchema,
  resources,
} from '@/lib/db/schema/resources';
import { db } from '../db';

export const createResource = async (input: NewResourceParams) => {
  try {
    const { content } = insertResourceSchema.parse(input);

    const [resource] = await db
      .insert(resources)
      .values({ content })
      .returning();

    return 'Resource successfully created.';
  } catch (e) {
    if (e instanceof Error)
      return e.message.length > 0 ? e.message : 'Error, please try again.';
  }
};
```

This function is a [Server Action](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations#with-client-components), as denoted by the `“use server”;` directive at the top of the file. This means that it can be called anywhere in your Next.js application. This function will take an input, run it through a [Zod](https://zod.dev) schema to ensure it adheres to the correct schema, and then creates a new resource in the database. This is the ideal location to generate and store embeddings of the newly created resources.

Update the file with the following code:

```tsx filename="lib/actions/resources.ts" highlight="9-10,21-27,29"
'use server';

import {
  NewResourceParams,
  insertResourceSchema,
  resources,
} from '@/lib/db/schema/resources';
import { db } from '../db';
import { generateEmbeddings } from '../ai/embedding';
import { embeddings as embeddingsTable } from '../db/schema/embeddings';

export const createResource = async (input: NewResourceParams) => {
  try {
    const { content } = insertResourceSchema.parse(input);

    const [resource] = await db
      .insert(resources)
      .values({ content })
      .returning();

    const embeddings = await generateEmbeddings(content);
    await db.insert(embeddingsTable).values(
      embeddings.map((embedding) => ({
        resourceId: resource.id,
        ...embedding,
      }))
    );

    return 'Resource successfully created and embedded.';
  } catch (error) {
    return error instanceof Error && error.message.length > 0
      ? error.message
      : 'Error, please try again.';
  }
};
```

First, you call the `generateEmbeddings` function created in the previous step, passing in the source material (`content`). Once you have your embeddings (`e`) of the source material, you can save them to the database, passing the `resourceId` alongside each embedding.

### Create Root Page

Great! Let's build the frontend. The AI SDK’s [`useChat`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat) hook allows you to easily create a conversational user interface for your agent.

Replace your root page (`app/page.tsx`) with the following code.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Chat() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat();
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col w-full max-w-md py-24 mx-auto stretch">
      <div className="space-y-4">
        {messages.map((m) => (
          <div key={m.id} className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
            <div>
              <div className="font-bold">{m.role}</div>
              {m.parts.map((part) => {
                switch (part.type) {
                  case 'text':
                    return <p>{part.text}</p>;
                }
              })}
            </div>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>

      <form
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          sendMessage({ text: input });
          setInput('');
        }}
      >
        <input
          className="fixed bottom-0 w-full max-w-md p-2 mb-8 border border-gray-300 rounded shadow-xl"
          value={input}
          placeholder="Say something..."
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.currentTarget.value)}
        />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `useChat` hook enables the streaming of chat messages from your AI provider (you will be using OpenAI via the Vercel AI Gateway), manages the state for chat input, and updates the UI automatically as new messages are received.

Run the following command to start the Next.js dev server:

<Snippet text="pnpm run dev" />

Head to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). You should see an empty screen with an input bar floating at the bottom. Try to send a message. The message shows up in the UI for a fraction of a second and then disappears. This is because you haven’t set up the corresponding API route to call the model! By default, `useChat` will send a POST request to the `/api/chat` endpoint with the `messages` as the request body.

<Note>You can customize the endpoint in the useChat configuration object</Note>

### Create API Route

In Next.js, you can create custom request handlers for a given route using [Route Handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers). Route Handlers are defined in a `route.ts` file and can export HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` etc.

Create a file at `app/api/chat/route.ts` by running the following command:

<Snippet text="mkdir -p app/api/chat && touch app/api/chat/route.ts" />

Open the file and add the following code:

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts"
import { convertToModelMessages, streamText, UIMessage } from 'ai';

// Allow streaming responses up to 30 seconds
export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

In this code, you declare and export an asynchronous function called POST. You retrieve the `messages` from the request body and then pass them to the [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text) function imported from the AI SDK, alongside the model you would like to use. Finally, you return the model’s response in `UIMessageStreamResponse` format.

Head back to the browser and try to send a message again. You should see a response from the model streamed directly in!

### Refining your prompt

While you now have a working agent, it isn't doing anything special.

Let’s add system instructions to refine and restrict the model’s behavior. In this case, you want the model to only use information it has retrieved to generate responses. Update your route handler with the following code:

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" highlight="12-14"
import { convertToModelMessages, streamText, UIMessage } from 'ai';

// Allow streaming responses up to 30 seconds
export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
    system: `You are a helpful assistant. Check your knowledge base before answering any questions.
    Only respond to questions using information from tool calls.
    if no relevant information is found in the tool calls, respond, "Sorry, I don't know."`,
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

Head back to the browser and try to ask the model what your favorite food is. The model should now respond exactly as you instructed above (“Sorry, I don’t know”) given it doesn’t have any relevant information.

In its current form, your agent is now, well, useless. How do you give the model the ability to add and query information?

### Using Tools

A [tool](/docs/foundations/tools) is a function that can be called by the model to perform a specific task. You can think of a tool like a program you give to the model that it can run as and when it deems necessary.

Let’s see how you can create a tool to give the model the ability to create, embed and save a resource to your agents’ knowledge base.

### Add Resource Tool

Update your route handler with the following code:

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" highlight="18-29"
import { createResource } from '@/lib/actions/resources';
import { convertToModelMessages, streamText, tool, UIMessage } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

// Allow streaming responses up to 30 seconds
export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
    system: `You are a helpful assistant. Check your knowledge base before answering any questions.
    Only respond to questions using information from tool calls.
    if no relevant information is found in the tool calls, respond, "Sorry, I don't know."`,
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
    tools: {
      addResource: tool({
        description: `add a resource to your knowledge base.
          If the user provides a random piece of knowledge unprompted, use this tool without asking for confirmation.`,
        inputSchema: z.object({
          content: z
            .string()
            .describe('the content or resource to add to the knowledge base'),
        }),
        execute: async ({ content }) => createResource({ content }),
      }),
    },
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

In this code, you define a tool called `addResource`. This tool has three elements:

- **description**: description of the tool that will influence when the tool is picked.
- **inputSchema**: [Zod schema](/docs/foundations/tools#schema-specification-and-validation-with-zod) that defines the input necessary for the tool to run.
- **execute**: An asynchronous function that is called with the arguments from the tool call.

In simple terms, on each generation, the model will decide whether it should call the tool. If it deems it should call the tool, it will extract the input and then append a new `message` to the `messages` array of type `tool-call`. The AI SDK will then run the `execute` function with the parameters provided by the `tool-call` message.

Head back to the browser and tell the model your favorite food. You should see an empty response in the UI. Did anything happen? Let’s see. Run the following command in a new terminal window.

<Snippet text="pnpm db:studio" />

This will start Drizzle Studio where we can view the rows in our database. You should see a new row in both the `embeddings` and `resources` table with your favorite food!

Let’s make a few changes in the UI to communicate to the user when a tool has been called. Head back to your root page (`app/page.tsx`) and add the following code:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" highlight="14-32"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Chat() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat();
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col w-full max-w-md py-24 mx-auto stretch">
      <div className="space-y-4">
        {messages.map((m) => (
          <div key={m.id} className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
            <div>
              <div className="font-bold">{m.role}</div>
              {m.parts.map((part) => {
                switch (part.type) {
                  case 'text':
                    return <p>{part.text}</p>;
                  case 'tool-addResource':
                  case 'tool-getInformation':
                    return (
                      <p>
                        call{part.state === 'output-available' ? 'ed' : 'ing'}{' '}
                        tool: {part.type}
                        <pre className="my-4 bg-zinc-100 p-2 rounded-sm">
                          {JSON.stringify(part.input, null, 2)}
                        </pre>
                      </p>
                    );
                }
              })}
            </div>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>

      <form
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          sendMessage({ text: input });
          setInput('');
        }}
      >
        <input
          className="fixed bottom-0 w-full max-w-md p-2 mb-8 border border-gray-300 rounded shadow-xl"
          value={input}
          placeholder="Say something..."
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.currentTarget.value)}
        />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

With this change, you now conditionally render the tool that has been called directly in the UI. Save the file and head back to browser. Tell the model your favorite movie. You should see which tool is called in place of the model’s typical text response.

<Note>
  Don't worry about the `tool-getInformation` tool case in the switch statement
  - we'll add that tool in a later section.
</Note>

### Improving UX with Multi-Step Calls

It would be nice if the model could summarize the action too. However, technically, once the model calls a tool, it has completed its generation as it ‘generated’ a tool call. How could you achieve this desired behaviour?

The AI SDK has a feature called [`stopWhen`](/docs/ai-sdk-core/tools-and-tool-calling#multi-step-calls) which allows stopping conditions when the model generates a tool call. If those stopping conditions haven't been hit, the AI SDK will automatically send tool call results back to the model!

Open your root page (`api/chat/route.ts`) and add the following key to the `streamText` configuration object:

```tsx filename="api/chat/route.ts" highlight="8,24"
import { createResource } from '@/lib/actions/resources';
import {
  convertToModelMessages,
  streamText,
  tool,
  UIMessage,
  stepCountIs,
} from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

// Allow streaming responses up to 30 seconds
export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
    system: `You are a helpful assistant. Check your knowledge base before answering any questions.
    Only respond to questions using information from tool calls.
    if no relevant information is found in the tool calls, respond, "Sorry, I don't know."`,
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
    stopWhen: stepCountIs(5),
    tools: {
      addResource: tool({
        description: `add a resource to your knowledge base.
          If the user provides a random piece of knowledge unprompted, use this tool without asking for confirmation.`,
        inputSchema: z.object({
          content: z
            .string()
            .describe('the content or resource to add to the knowledge base'),
        }),
        execute: async ({ content }) => createResource({ content }),
      }),
    },
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

Head back to the browser and tell the model your favorite pizza topping (note: pineapple is not an option). You should see a follow-up response from the model confirming the action.

### Retrieve Resource Tool

The model can now add and embed arbitrary information to your knowledge base. However, it still isn’t able to query it. Let’s create a new tool to allow the model to answer questions by finding relevant information in your knowledge base.

To find similar content, you will need to embed the users query, search the database for semantic similarities, then pass those items to the model as context alongside the query. To achieve this, let’s update your embedding logic file (`lib/ai/embedding.ts`):

```tsx filename="lib/ai/embedding.ts" highlight="1,3-5,27-34,36-49"
import { embed, embedMany } from 'ai';
import { db } from '../db';
import { cosineDistance, desc, gt, sql } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { embeddings } from '../db/schema/embeddings';

const embeddingModel = 'openai/text-embedding-ada-002';

const generateChunks = (input: string): string[] => {
  return input
    .trim()
    .split('.')
    .filter((i) => i !== '');
};

export const generateEmbeddings = async (
  value: string
): Promise<Array<{ embedding: number[]; content: string }>> => {
  const chunks = generateChunks(value);
  const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
    model: embeddingModel,
    values: chunks,
  });
  return embeddings.map((e, i) => ({ content: chunks[i], embedding: e }));
};

export const generateEmbedding = async (value: string): Promise<number[]> => {
  const input = value.replaceAll('\\n', ' ');
  const { embedding } = await embed({
    model: embeddingModel,
    value: input,
  });
  return embedding;
};

export const findRelevantContent = async (userQuery: string) => {
  const userQueryEmbedded = await generateEmbedding(userQuery);
  const similarity = sql<number>`1 - (${cosineDistance(
    embeddings.embedding,
    userQueryEmbedded
  )})`;
  const similarGuides = await db
    .select({ name: embeddings.content, similarity })
    .from(embeddings)
    .where(gt(similarity, 0.5))
    .orderBy((t) => desc(t.similarity))
    .limit(4);
  return similarGuides;
};
```

In this code, you add two functions:

- `generateEmbedding`: generate a single embedding from an input string
- `findRelevantContent`: embeds the user’s query, searches the database for similar items, then returns relevant items

With that done, it’s onto the final step: creating the tool.

Go back to your route handler (`api/chat/route.ts`) and add a new tool called `getInformation`:

```ts filename="api/chat/route.ts" highlight="11,37-43"
import { createResource } from '@/lib/actions/resources';
import {
  convertToModelMessages,
  streamText,
  tool,
  UIMessage,
  stepCountIs,
} from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';
import { findRelevantContent } from '@/lib/ai/embedding';

// Allow streaming responses up to 30 seconds
export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
    stopWhen: stepCountIs(5),
    system: `You are a helpful assistant. Check your knowledge base before answering any questions.
    Only respond to questions using information from tool calls.
    if no relevant information is found in the tool calls, respond, "Sorry, I don't know."`,
    tools: {
      addResource: tool({
        description: `add a resource to your knowledge base.
          If the user provides a random piece of knowledge unprompted, use this tool without asking for confirmation.`,
        inputSchema: z.object({
          content: z
            .string()
            .describe('the content or resource to add to the knowledge base'),
        }),
        execute: async ({ content }) => createResource({ content }),
      }),
      getInformation: tool({
        description: `get information from your knowledge base to answer questions.`,
        inputSchema: z.object({
          question: z.string().describe('the users question'),
        }),
        execute: async ({ question }) => findRelevantContent(question),
      }),
    },
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

Head back to the browser, refresh the page, and ask for your favorite food. You should see the model call the `getInformation` tool, and then use the relevant information to formulate a response!

## Conclusion

Congratulations, you have successfully built an AI agent that can dynamically add and retrieve information to and from a knowledge base. Throughout this guide, you learned how to create and store embeddings, set up server actions to manage resources, and use tools to extend the capabilities of your agent.

## Troubleshooting Migration Error

If you experience an error with the migration, open your migration file (`lib/db/migrations/0000_yielding_bloodaxe.sql`), cut (copy and remove) the first line, and run it directly on your postgres instance. You should now be able to run the updated migration.

If you're using the Vercel setup above, you can run the command directly by either:

- Going to the Neon console and entering the command there, or
- Going back to the Vercel platform, navigating to the Quick Start section of your database, and finding the PSQL connection command (second tab). This will connect to your instance in the terminal where you can run the command directly.

# Multi-Modal Agent

In this guide, you will build a multi-modal agent capable of understanding both images and PDFs.

Multi-modal refers to the ability of the agent to understand and generate responses in multiple formats. In this guide, we'll focus on images and PDFs - two common document types that modern language models can process natively.

<Note>
  For a complete list of providers and their multi-modal capabilities, visit the
  [providers documentation](/providers/ai-sdk-providers).
</Note>

We'll build this agent using OpenAI's GPT-4o, but the same code works seamlessly with other providers - you can switch between them by changing just one line of code.

## Prerequisites

To follow this quickstart, you'll need:

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm installed on your local development machine.
- A Vercel AI Gateway API key.

If you haven't obtained your Vercel AI Gateway API key, you can do so by [signing up](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fai&title=Go+to+AI+Gateway) on the Vercel website.

## Create Your Application

Start by creating a new Next.js application. This command will create a new directory named `multi-modal-agent` and set up a basic Next.js application inside it.

<div className="mb-4">
  <Note>
    Be sure to select yes when prompted to use the App Router. If you are
    looking for the Next.js Pages Router quickstart guide, you can find it
    [here](/docs/getting-started/nextjs-pages-router).
  </Note>
</div>

<Snippet text="pnpm create next-app@latest multi-modal-agent" />

Navigate to the newly created directory:

<Snippet text="cd multi-modal-agent" />

### Install dependencies

Install `ai` and `@ai-sdk/react`, the AI SDK package and the AI SDK's React package respectively.

<Note>
  The AI SDK is designed to be a unified interface to interact with any large
  language model. This means that you can change model and providers with just
  one line of code! Learn more about [available providers](/providers) and
  [building custom providers](/providers/community-providers/custom-providers)
  in the [providers](/providers) section.
</Note>

  </Tabs>
</div>

### Configure your Vercel AI Gateway API key

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root and add your Vercel AI Gateway API key. This key authenticates your application with Vercel AI Gateway.

<Snippet text="touch .env.local" />

Edit the `.env.local` file:

```env filename=".env.local"
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual Vercel AI Gateway API key.

<Note className="mb-4">
  The AI SDK's Vercel AI Gateway Provider is the default global provider, so you
  can access models using a simple string in the model configuration. If you
  prefer to use a specific provider like OpenAI directly, see the [provider
  management](/docs/ai-sdk-core/provider-management) documentation.
</Note>

## Implementation Plan

To build a multi-modal agent, you will need to:

- Create a Route Handler to handle incoming chat messages and generate responses.
- Wire up the UI to display chat messages, provide a user input, and handle submitting new messages.
- Add the ability to upload images and PDFs and attach them alongside the chat messages.

## Create a Route Handler

Create a route handler, `app/api/chat/route.ts` and add the following code:

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts"
import { streamText, convertToModelMessages, type UIMessage } from 'ai';

// Allow streaming responses up to 30 seconds
export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

Let's take a look at what is happening in this code:

1. Define an asynchronous `POST` request handler and extract `messages` from the body of the request. The `messages` variable contains a history of the conversation between you and the agent and provides the agent with the necessary context to make the next generation.
2. Convert the UI messages to model messages using `convertToModelMessages`, which transforms the UI-focused message format to the format expected by the language model.
3. Call [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text), which is imported from the `ai` package. This function accepts a configuration object that contains a `model` provider and `messages` (converted in step 2). You can pass additional [settings](/docs/ai-sdk-core/settings) to further customise the model's behaviour.
4. The `streamText` function returns a [`StreamTextResult`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text#result-object). This result object contains the [ `toUIMessageStreamResponse` ](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text#to-ui-message-stream-response) function which converts the result to a streamed response object.
5. Finally, return the result to the client to stream the response.

This Route Handler creates a POST request endpoint at `/api/chat`.

## Wire up the UI

Now that you have a Route Handler that can query a large language model (LLM), it's time to setup your frontend. [ AI SDK UI ](/docs/ai-sdk-ui) abstracts the complexity of a chat interface into one hook, [`useChat`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat).

Update your root page (`app/page.tsx`) with the following code to show a list of chat messages and provide a user message input:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { DefaultChatTransport } from 'ai';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Chat() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');

  const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat({
    transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
      api: '/api/chat',
    }),
  });

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col w-full max-w-md py-24 mx-auto stretch">
      {messages.map((m) => (
        <div key={m.id} className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
          {m.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
          {m.parts.map((part, index) => {
            if (part.type === 'text') {
              return <span key={`${m.id}-text-${index}`}>{part.text}</span>;
            }
            return null;
          })}
        </div>
      ))}

      <form
        onSubmit={async (event) => {
          event.preventDefault();
          sendMessage({
            role: 'user',
            parts: [{ type: 'text', text: input }],
          });
          setInput('');
        }}
        className="fixed bottom-0 w-full max-w-md mb-8 border border-gray-300 rounded shadow-xl"
      >
        <input
          className="w-full p-2"
          value={input}
          placeholder="Say something..."
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
        />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Note>
  Make sure you add the `"use client"` directive to the top of your file. This
  allows you to add interactivity with Javascript.
</Note>

This page utilizes the `useChat` hook, configured with `DefaultChatTransport` to specify the API endpoint. The `useChat` hook provides multiple utility functions and state variables:

- `messages` - the current chat messages (an array of objects with `id`, `role`, and `parts` properties).
- `sendMessage` - function to send a new message to the AI.
- Each message contains a `parts` array that can include text, images, PDFs, and other content types.
- Files are converted to data URLs before being sent to maintain compatibility across different environments.

## Add File Upload

To make your agent multi-modal, let's add the ability to upload and send both images and PDFs to the model. In v5, files are sent as part of the message's `parts` array. Files are converted to data URLs using the FileReader API before being sent to the server.

Update your root page (`app/page.tsx`) with the following code:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" highlight="4-5,10-12,15-39,46-81,87-97"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { DefaultChatTransport } from 'ai';
import { useRef, useState } from 'react';
import Image from 'next/image';

async function convertFilesToDataURLs(files: FileList) {
  return Promise.all(
    Array.from(files).map(
      (file) =>
        new Promise<{
          type: 'file';
          mediaType: string;
          url: string;
        }>((resolve, reject) => {
          const reader = new FileReader();
          reader.onload = () => {
            resolve({
              type: 'file',
              mediaType: file.type,
              url: reader.result as string,
            });
          };
          reader.onerror = reject;
          reader.readAsDataURL(file);
        })
    )
  );
}

export default function Chat() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const [files, setFiles] = useState<FileList | undefined>(undefined);
  const fileInputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

  const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat({
    transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
      api: '/api/chat',
    }),
  });

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col w-full max-w-md py-24 mx-auto stretch">
      {messages.map((m) => (
        <div key={m.id} className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
          {m.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
          {m.parts.map((part, index) => {
            if (part.type === 'text') {
              return <span key={`${m.id}-text-${index}`}>{part.text}</span>;
            }
            if (part.type === 'file' && part.mediaType?.startsWith('image/')) {
              return (
                <Image
                  key={`${m.id}-image-${index}`}
                  src={part.url}
                  width={500}
                  height={500}
                  alt={`attachment-${index}`}
                />
              );
            }
            if (part.type === 'file' && part.mediaType === 'application/pdf') {
              return (
                <iframe
                  key={`${m.id}-pdf-${index}`}
                  src={part.url}
                  width={500}
                  height={600}
                  title={`pdf-${index}`}
                />
              );
            }
            return null;
          })}
        </div>
      ))}

      <form
        className="fixed bottom-0 w-full max-w-md p-2 mb-8 border border-gray-300 rounded shadow-xl space-y-2"
        onSubmit={async (event) => {
          event.preventDefault();

          const fileParts =
            files && files.length > 0
              ? await convertFilesToDataURLs(files)
              : [];

          sendMessage({
            role: 'user',
            parts: [{ type: 'text', text: input }, ...fileParts],
          });

          setInput('');
          setFiles(undefined);

          if (fileInputRef.current) {
            fileInputRef.current.value = '';
          }
        }}
      >
        <input
          type="file"
          accept="image/*,application/pdf"
          className=""
          onChange={(event) => {
            if (event.target.files) {
              setFiles(event.target.files);
            }
          }}
          multiple
          ref={fileInputRef}
        />
        <input
          className="w-full p-2"
          value={input}
          placeholder="Say something..."
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
        />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this code, you:

1. Add a helper function `convertFilesToDataURLs` to convert file uploads to data URLs.
1. Create state to hold the input text, files, and a ref to the file input field.
1. Configure `useChat` with `DefaultChatTransport` to specify the API endpoint.
1. Display messages using the `parts` array structure, rendering text, images, and PDFs appropriately.
1. Update the `onSubmit` function to send messages with the `sendMessage` function, including both text and file parts.
1. Add a file input field to the form, including an `onChange` handler to handle updating the files state.

## Running Your Application

With that, you have built everything you need for your multi-modal agent! To start your application, use the command:

<Snippet text="pnpm run dev" />

Head to your browser and open http://localhost:3000. You should see an input field and a button to upload files.

Try uploading an image or PDF and asking the model questions about it. Watch as the model's response is streamed back to you!

## Using Other Providers

With the AI SDK's unified provider interface you can easily switch to other providers that support multi-modal capabilities:

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts"
// Using Anthropic
const result = streamText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
  messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
});

// Using Google
const result = streamText({
  model: 'google/gemini-2.5-flash',
  messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
});
```

Install the provider package (`@ai-sdk/anthropic` or `@ai-sdk/google`) and update your API keys in `.env.local`. The rest of your code remains the same.

<Note>
  Different providers may have varying file size limits and performance
  characteristics. Check the [provider
  documentation](/providers/ai-sdk-providers) for specific details.
</Note>

# Building an AI Agent in Slack with the AI SDK

In this guide, you will learn how to build a Slackbot powered by the AI SDK. The bot will be able to respond to direct messages and mentions in channels using the full context of the thread.

## Slack App Setup

Before we start building, you'll need to create and configure a Slack app:

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click "Create New App" and choose "From scratch"
3. Give your app a name and select your workspace
4. Under "OAuth & Permissions", add the following bot token scopes:
   - `app_mentions:read`
   - `chat:write`
   - `im:history`
   - `im:write`
   - `assistant:write`
5. Install the app to your workspace (button under "OAuth Tokens" subsection)
6. Copy the Bot User OAuth Token and Signing Secret for the next step
7. Under App Home -> Show Tabs -> Chat Tab, check "Allow users to send Slash commands and messages from the chat tab"

## Project Setup

This project uses the following stack:

- [AI SDK by Vercel](/docs)
- [Slack Web API](https://api.slack.com/web)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com)

## Getting Started

1. Clone [the repository](https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai-sdk-slackbot) and check out the `starter` branch

<Snippet
text={[
'git clone https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai-sdk-slackbot.git',
'cd ai-sdk-slackbot',
'git checkout starter',
]}
/>

2. Install dependencies

<Snippet text={['pnpm install']} />

## Project Structure

The starter repository already includes:

- Slack utilities (`lib/slack-utils.ts`) including functions for validating incoming requests, converting Slack threads to AI SDK compatible message formats, and getting the Slackbot's user ID
- General utility functions (`lib/utils.ts`) including initial Exa setup
- Files to handle the different types of Slack events (`lib/handle-messages.ts` and `lib/handle-app-mention.ts`)
- An API endpoint (`POST`) for Slack events (`api/events.ts`)

## Event Handler

First, let's take a look at our API route (`api/events.ts`):

```typescript
import type { SlackEvent } from '@slack/web-api';
import {
  assistantThreadMessage,
  handleNewAssistantMessage,
} from '../lib/handle-messages';
import { waitUntil } from '@vercel/functions';
import { handleNewAppMention } from '../lib/handle-app-mention';
import { verifyRequest, getBotId } from '../lib/slack-utils';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const rawBody = await request.text();
  const payload = JSON.parse(rawBody);
  const requestType = payload.type as 'url_verification' | 'event_callback';

  // See https://api.slack.com/events/url_verification
  if (requestType === 'url_verification') {
    return new Response(payload.challenge, { status: 200 });
  }

  await verifyRequest({ requestType, request, rawBody });

  try {
    const botUserId = await getBotId();

    const event = payload.event as SlackEvent;

    if (event.type === 'app_mention') {
      waitUntil(handleNewAppMention(event, botUserId));
    }

    if (event.type === 'assistant_thread_started') {
      waitUntil(assistantThreadMessage(event));
    }

    if (
      event.type === 'message' &&
      !event.subtype &&
      event.channel_type === 'im' &&
      !event.bot_id &&
      !event.bot_profile &&
      event.bot_id !== botUserId
    ) {
      waitUntil(handleNewAssistantMessage(event, botUserId));
    }

    return new Response('Success!', { status: 200 });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error generating response', error);
    return new Response('Error generating response', { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

This file defines a `POST` function that handles incoming requests from Slack. First, you check the request type to see if it's a URL verification request. If it is, you respond with the challenge string provided by Slack. If it's an event callback, you verify the request and then have access to the event data. This is where you can implement your event handling logic.

You then handle three types of events: `app_mention`, `assistant_thread_started`, and `message`:

- For `app_mention`, you call `handleNewAppMention` with the event and the bot user ID.
- For `assistant_thread_started`, you call `assistantThreadMessage` with the event.
- For `message`, you call `handleNewAssistantMessage` with the event and the bot user ID.

Finally, you respond with a success message to Slack. Note, each handler function is wrapped in a `waitUntil` function. Let's take a look at what this means and why it's important.

### The waitUntil Function

Slack expects a response within 3 seconds to confirm the request is being handled. However, generating AI responses can take longer. If you don't respond to the Slack request within 3 seconds, Slack will send another request, leading to another invocation of your API route, another call to the LLM, and ultimately another response to the user. To solve this, you can use the `waitUntil` function, which allows you to run your AI logic after the response is sent, without blocking the response itself.

This means, your API endpoint will:

1. Immediately respond to Slack (within 3 seconds)
2. Continue processing the message asynchronously
3. Send the AI response when it's ready

## Event Handlers

Let's look at how each event type is currently handled.

### App Mentions

When a user mentions your bot in a channel, the `app_mention` event is triggered. The `handleNewAppMention` function in `handle-app-mention.ts` processes these mentions:

1. Checks if the message is from a bot to avoid infinite response loops
2. Creates a status updater to show the bot is "thinking"
3. If the mention is in a thread, it retrieves the thread history
4. Calls the LLM with the message content (using the `generateResponse` function which you will implement in the next section)
5. Updates the initial "thinking" message with the AI response

Here's the code for the `handleNewAppMention` function:

```typescript filename="lib/handle-app-mention.ts"
import { AppMentionEvent } from '@slack/web-api';
import { client, getThread } from './slack-utils';
import { generateResponse } from './ai';

const updateStatusUtil = async (
  initialStatus: string,
  event: AppMentionEvent
) => {
  const initialMessage = await client.chat.postMessage({
    channel: event.channel,
    thread_ts: event.thread_ts ?? event.ts,
    text: initialStatus,
  });

  if (!initialMessage || !initialMessage.ts)
    throw new Error('Failed to post initial message');

  const updateMessage = async (status: string) => {
    await client.chat.update({
      channel: event.channel,
      ts: initialMessage.ts as string,
      text: status,
    });
  };
  return updateMessage;
};

export async function handleNewAppMention(
  event: AppMentionEvent,
  botUserId: string
) {
  console.log('Handling app mention');
  if (event.bot_id || event.bot_id === botUserId || event.bot_profile) {
    console.log('Skipping app mention');
    return;
  }

  const { thread_ts, channel } = event;
  const updateMessage = await updateStatusUtil('is thinking...', event);

  if (thread_ts) {
    const messages = await getThread(channel, thread_ts, botUserId);
    const result = await generateResponse(messages, updateMessage);
    updateMessage(result);
  } else {
    const result = await generateResponse(
      [{ role: 'user', content: event.text }],
      updateMessage
    );
    updateMessage(result);
  }
}
```

Now let's see how new assistant threads and messages are handled.

### Assistant Thread Messages

When a user starts a thread with your assistant, the `assistant_thread_started` event is triggered. The `assistantThreadMessage` function in `handle-messages.ts` handles this:

1. Posts a welcome message to the thread
2. Sets up suggested prompts to help users get started

Here's the code for the `assistantThreadMessage` function:

```typescript filename="lib/handle-messages.ts"
import type { AssistantThreadStartedEvent } from '@slack/web-api';
import { client } from './slack-utils';

export async function assistantThreadMessage(
  event: AssistantThreadStartedEvent
) {
  const { channel_id, thread_ts } = event.assistant_thread;
  console.log(`Thread started: ${channel_id} ${thread_ts}`);
  console.log(JSON.stringify(event));

  await client.chat.postMessage({
    channel: channel_id,
    thread_ts: thread_ts,
    text: "Hello, I'm an AI assistant built with the AI SDK by Vercel!",
  });

  await client.assistant.threads.setSuggestedPrompts({
    channel_id: channel_id,
    thread_ts: thread_ts,
    prompts: [
      {
        title: 'Get the weather',
        message: 'What is the current weather in London?',
      },
      {
        title: 'Get the news',
        message: 'What is the latest Premier League news from the BBC?',
      },
    ],
  });
}
```

### Direct Messages

For direct messages to your bot, the `message` event is triggered and the event is handled by the `handleNewAssistantMessage` function in `handle-messages.ts`:

1. Verifies the message isn't from a bot
2. Updates the status to show the response is being generated
3. Retrieves the conversation history
4. Calls the LLM with the conversation context
5. Posts the LLM's response to the thread

Here's the code for the `handleNewAssistantMessage` function:

```typescript filename="lib/handle-messages.ts"
import type { GenericMessageEvent } from '@slack/web-api';
import { client, getThread } from './slack-utils';
import { generateResponse } from './ai';

export async function handleNewAssistantMessage(
  event: GenericMessageEvent,
  botUserId: string
) {
  if (
    event.bot_id ||
    event.bot_id === botUserId ||
    event.bot_profile ||
    !event.thread_ts
  )
    return;

  const { thread_ts, channel } = event;
  const updateStatus = updateStatusUtil(channel, thread_ts);
  updateStatus('is thinking...');

  const messages = await getThread(channel, thread_ts, botUserId);
  const result = await generateResponse(messages, updateStatus);

  await client.chat.postMessage({
    channel: channel,
    thread_ts: thread_ts,
    text: result,
    unfurl_links: false,
    blocks: [
      {
        type: 'section',
        text: {
          type: 'mrkdwn',
          text: result,
        },
      },
    ],
  });

  updateStatus('');
}
```

With the event handlers in place, let's now implement the AI logic.

## Implementing AI Logic

The core of our application is the `generateResponse` function in `lib/generate-response.ts`, which processes messages and generates responses using the AI SDK.

Here's how to implement it:

```typescript filename="lib/generate-response.ts"
import { generateText, ModelMessage } from 'ai';

export const generateResponse = async (
  messages: ModelMessage[],
  updateStatus?: (status: string) => void
) => {
  const { text } = await generateText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    system: `You are a Slack bot assistant. Keep your responses concise and to the point.
    - Do not tag users.
    - Current date is: ${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}`,
    messages,
  });

  // Convert markdown to Slack mrkdwn format
  return text.replace(/\[(.*?)\]\((.*?)\)/g, '<$2|$1>').replace(/\*\*/g, '*');
};
```

This basic implementation:

1. Uses the AI SDK's `generateText` function to call Anthropic's `claude-sonnet-4.5` model
2. Provides a system prompt to guide the model's behavior
3. Formats the response for Slack's markdown format

## Enhancing with Tools

The real power of the AI SDK comes from tools that enable your bot to perform actions. Let's add two useful tools:

```typescript filename="lib/generate-response.ts"
import { generateText, tool, ModelMessage, stepCountIs } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';
import { exa } from './utils';

export const generateResponse = async (
  messages: ModelMessage[],
  updateStatus?: (status: string) => void
) => {
  const { text } = await generateText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    system: `You are a Slack bot assistant. Keep your responses concise and to the point.
    - Do not tag users.
    - Current date is: ${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}
    - Always include sources in your final response if you use web search.`,
    messages,
    stopWhen: stepCountIs(10),
    tools: {
      getWeather: tool({
        description: 'Get the current weather at a location',
        inputSchema: z.object({
          latitude: z.number(),
          longitude: z.number(),
          city: z.string(),
        }),
        execute: async ({ latitude, longitude, city }) => {
          updateStatus?.(`is getting weather for ${city}...`);

          const response = await fetch(
            `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=${latitude}&longitude=${longitude}&current=temperature_2m,weathercode,relativehumidity_2m&timezone=auto`
          );

          const weatherData = await response.json();
          return {
            temperature: weatherData.current.temperature_2m,
            weatherCode: weatherData.current.weathercode,
            humidity: weatherData.current.relativehumidity_2m,
            city,
          };
        },
      }),
      searchWeb: tool({
        description: 'Use this to search the web for information',
        inputSchema: z.object({
          query: z.string(),
          specificDomain: z
            .string()
            .nullable()
            .describe(
              'a domain to search if the user specifies e.g. bbc.com. Should be only the domain name without the protocol'
            ),
        }),
        execute: async ({ query, specificDomain }) => {
          updateStatus?.(`is searching the web for ${query}...`);
          const { results } = await exa.searchAndContents(query, {
            livecrawl: 'always',
            numResults: 3,
            includeDomains: specificDomain ? [specificDomain] : undefined,
          });

          return {
            results: results.map((result) => ({
              title: result.title,
              url: result.url,
              snippet: result.text.slice(0, 1000),
            })),
          };
        },
      }),
    },
  });

  // Convert markdown to Slack mrkdwn format
  return text.replace(/\[(.*?)\]\((.*?)\)/g, '<$2|$1>').replace(/\*\*/g, '*');
};
```

In this updated implementation:

1. You added two tools:

   - `getWeather`: Fetches weather data for a specified location
   - `searchWeb`: Searches the web for information using the Exa API

2. You set `stopWhen: stepCountIs(10)` to enable multi-step conversations. This defines the stopping conditions of your agent, when the model generates a tool call. This will automatically send any tool results back to the LLM to trigger additional tool calls or responses as the LLM deems necessary. This turns your LLM call from a one-off operation into a multi-step agentic flow.

## How It Works

When a user interacts with your bot:

1. The Slack event is received and processed by your API endpoint
2. The user's message and the thread history is passed to the `generateResponse` function
3. The AI SDK processes the message and may invoke tools as needed
4. The response is formatted for Slack and sent back to the user

The tools are automatically invoked based on the user's intent. For example, if a user asks "What's the weather in London?", the AI will:

1. Recognize this as a weather query
2. Call the `getWeather` tool with London's coordinates (inferred by the LLM)
3. Process the weather data
4. Generate a final response, answering the user's question

## Deploying the App

1. Install the Vercel CLI

<Snippet text={['pnpm install -g vercel']} />

2. Deploy the app

<Snippet text={['vercel deploy']} />

3. Copy the deployment URL and update the Slack app's Event Subscriptions to point to your Vercel URL
4. Go to your project's deployment settings (Your project -> Settings -> Environment Variables) and add your environment variables

```bash
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=your_slack_bot_token
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your_slack_signing_secret
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
EXA_API_KEY=your_exa_api_key
```

<Note>
  Make sure to redeploy your app after updating environment variables.
</Note>

5. Head back to the [https://api.slack.com/](https://api.slack.com/) and navigate to the "Event Subscriptions" page. Enable events and add your deployment URL.

```bash
https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app/api/events
```

6. On the Events Subscription page, subscribe to the following events.
   - `app_mention`
   - `assistant_thread_started`
   - `message:im`

Finally, head to Slack and test the app by sending a message to the bot.

## Next Steps

You've built a Slack chatbot powered by the AI SDK! Here are some ways you could extend it:

1. Add memory for specific users to give the LLM context of previous interactions
2. Implement more tools like database queries or knowledge base searches
3. Add support for rich message formatting with blocks
4. Add analytics to track usage patterns

<Note>
  In a production environment, it is recommended to implement a robust queueing
  system to ensure messages are properly handled.

# Natural Language Postgres Guide

In this guide, you will learn how to build an app that uses AI to interact with a PostgreSQL database using natural language.

The application will:

- Generate SQL queries from a natural language input
- Explain query components in plain English
- Create a chart to visualise query results

You can find a completed version of this project at [natural-language-postgres.vercel.app](https://natural-language-postgres.vercel.app).

## Project setup

This project uses the following stack:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (App Router)
- [AI SDK](/docs)
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com)
- [Zod](https://zod.dev)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) with [ Vercel Postgres ](https://vercel.com/postgres)
- [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling
- [Recharts](https://recharts.org) for data visualization

### Clone repo

To focus on the AI-powered functionality rather than project setup and configuration we've prepared a starter repository which includes a database schema and a few components.

Clone the starter repository and check out the `starter` branch:

<Snippet
text={[
'git clone https://github.com/vercel-labs/natural-language-postgres',
'cd natural-language-postgres',
'git checkout starter',
]}
/>

### Project setup and data

Let's set up the project and seed the database with the dataset:

1. Install dependencies:

<Snippet text={['pnpm install']} />

2. Copy the example environment variables file:

<Snippet text={['cp .env.example .env']} />

3. Add your environment variables to `.env`:

```bash filename=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
POSTGRES_URL="..."
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL="..."
POSTGRES_URL_NO_SSL="..."
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING="..."
POSTGRES_USER="..."
POSTGRES_HOST="..."
POSTGRES_PASSWORD="..."
POSTGRES_DATABASE="..."
```

4. This project uses CB Insights' Unicorn Companies dataset. You can download the dataset by following these instructions:
   - Navigate to [CB Insights Unicorn Companies](https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies)
   - Enter in your email. You will receive a link to download the dataset.
   - Save it as `unicorns.csv` in your project root

<Note>
  You will need a Postgres database to complete this tutorial. If you don't have
  Postgres setup on your local machine you can: - Create a free Postgres
  database with Vercel (recommended - see instructions below); or - Follow [this
  guide](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/postgresql/setting-up-a-local-postgresql-database)
  to set it up locally
</Note>

1. In the Quick Start section, click **Show secrets**
1. Copy the full `DATABASE_URL` environment variable and use it to populate the Postgres environment variables in your `.env` file

### About the dataset

The Unicorn List dataset contains the following information about unicorn startups (companies with a valuation above $1bn):

- Company name
- Valuation
- Date joined (unicorn status)
- Country
- City
- Industry
- Select investors

This dataset contains over 1000 rows of data over 7 columns, giving us plenty of structured data to analyze. This makes it perfect for exploring various SQL queries that can reveal interesting insights about the unicorn startup ecosystem.

5. Now that you have the dataset downloaded and added to your project, you can initialize the database with the following command:

<Snippet text={['pnpm run seed']} />

Note: this step can take a little while. You should see a message indicating the Unicorns table has been created and then that the database has been seeded successfully.

<Note>
  Remember, the dataset should be named `unicorns.csv` and located in root of
  your project.
</Note>

6. Start the development server:

<Snippet text={['pnpm run dev']} />

Your application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Project structure

The starter repository already includes everything that you will need, including:

- Database seed script (`lib/seed.ts`)
- Basic components built with shadcn/ui (`components/`)
- Function to run SQL queries (`app/actions.ts`)
- Type definitions for the database schema (`lib/types.ts`)

### Existing components

The application contains a single page in `app/page.tsx` that serves as the main interface.

At the top, you'll find a header (`header.tsx`) displaying the application title and description. Below that is an input field and search button (`search.tsx`) where you can enter natural language queries.

Initially, the page shows a collection of suggested example queries (`suggested-queries.tsx`) that you can click to quickly try out the functionality.

When you submit a query:

- The suggested queries section disappears and a loading state appears
- Once complete, a card appears with "TODO - IMPLEMENT ABOVE" (`query-viewer.tsx`) which will eventually show your generated SQL
- Below that is an empty results area with "No results found" (`results.tsx`)

After you implement the core functionality:

- The results section will display data in a table format
- A toggle button will allow switching between table and chart views
- The chart view will visualize your query results

Let's implement the AI-powered functionality to bring it all together.

## Building the application

As a reminder, this application will have three main features:

1. Generate SQL queries from natural language
2. Create a chart from the query results
3. Explain SQL queries in plain English

For each of these features, you'll use the AI SDK via [ Server Actions ](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-actions) to interact with OpenAI's GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini models. Server Actions are a powerful React Server Component feature that allows you to call server-side functions directly from your frontend code.

Let's start with generating a SQL query from natural language.

## Generate SQL queries

### Providing context

For the model to generate accurate SQL queries, it needs context about your database schema, tables, and relationships. You will communicate this information through a prompt that should include:

1. Schema information
2. Example data formats
3. Available SQL operations
4. Best practices for query structure
5. Nuanced advice for specific fields

Let's write a prompt that includes all of this information:

```txt
You are a SQL (postgres) and data visualization expert. Your job is to help the user write a SQL query to retrieve the data they need. The table schema is as follows:

unicorns (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  company VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  valuation DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  date_joined DATE,
  country VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  city VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  industry VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  select_investors TEXT NOT NULL
);

Only retrieval queries are allowed.

For things like industry, company names and other string fields, use the ILIKE operator and convert both the search term and the field to lowercase using LOWER() function. For example: LOWER(industry) ILIKE LOWER('%search_term%').

Note: select_investors is a comma-separated list of investors. Trim whitespace to ensure you're grouping properly. Note, some fields may be null or have only one value.
When answering questions about a specific field, ensure you are selecting the identifying column (ie. what is Vercel's valuation would select company and valuation').

The industries available are:
- healthcare & life sciences
- consumer & retail
- financial services
- enterprise tech
- insurance
- media & entertainment
- industrials
- health

If the user asks for a category that is not in the list, infer based on the list above.

Note: valuation is in billions of dollars so 10b would be 10.0.
Note: if the user asks for a rate, return it as a decimal. For example, 0.1 would be 10%.

If the user asks for 'over time' data, return by year.

When searching for UK or USA, write out United Kingdom or United States respectively.

EVERY QUERY SHOULD RETURN QUANTITATIVE DATA THAT CAN BE PLOTTED ON A CHART! There should always be at least two columns. If the user asks for a single column, return the column and the count of the column. If the user asks for a rate, return the rate as a decimal. For example, 0.1 would be 10%.
```

There are several important elements of this prompt:

- Schema description helps the model understand exactly what data fields to work with
- Includes rules for handling queries based on common SQL patterns - for example, always using ILIKE for case-insensitive string matching
- Explains how to handle edge cases in the dataset, like dealing with the comma-separated investors field and ensuring whitespace is properly handled
- Instead of having the model guess at industry categories, it provides the exact list that exists in the data, helping avoid mismatches
- The prompt helps standardize data transformations - like knowing to interpret "10b" as "10.0" billion dollars, or that rates should be decimal values
- Clear rules ensure the query output will be chart-friendly by always including at least two columns of data that can be plotted

This prompt structure provides a strong foundation for query generation, but you should experiment and iterate based on your specific needs and the model you're using.

### Create a Server Action

With the prompt done, let's create a Server Action.

Open `app/actions.ts`. You should see one action already defined (`runGeneratedSQLQuery`).

Add a new action. This action should be asynchronous and take in one parameter - the natural language query.

```ts filename="app/actions.ts"
/* ...rest of the file... */

export const generateQuery = async (input: string) => {};
```

In this action, you'll use the `generateObject` function from the AI SDK which allows you to constrain the model's output to a pre-defined schema. This process, sometimes called structured output, ensures the model returns only the SQL query without any additional prefixes, explanations, or formatting that would require manual parsing.

```ts filename="app/actions.ts"
/* ...other imports... */
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

/* ...rest of the file... */

export const generateQuery = async (input: string) => {
  'use server';
  try {
    const result = await generateObject({
      model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
      system: `You are a SQL (postgres) ...`, // SYSTEM PROMPT AS ABOVE - OMITTED FOR BREVITY
      prompt: `Generate the query necessary to retrieve the data the user wants: ${input}`,
      schema: z.object({
        query: z.string(),
      }),
    });
    return result.object.query;
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
    throw new Error('Failed to generate query');
  }
};
```

Note, you are constraining the output to a single string field called `query` using `zod`, a TypeScript schema validation library. This will ensure the model only returns the SQL query itself. The resulting generated query will then be returned.

### Update the frontend

With the Server Action in place, you can now update the frontend to call this action when the user submits a natural language query. In the root page (`app/page.tsx`), you should see a `handleSubmit` function that is called when the user submits a query.

Import the `generateQuery` function and call it with the user's input.

```typescript filename="app/page.tsx" highlight="21"
/* ...other imports... */
import { runGeneratedSQLQuery, generateQuery } from './actions';

/* ...rest of the file... */

const handleSubmit = async (suggestion?: string) => {
  clearExistingData();

  const question = suggestion ?? inputValue;
  if (inputValue.length === 0 && !suggestion) return;

  if (question.trim()) {
    setSubmitted(true);
  }

  setLoading(true);
  setLoadingStep(1);
  setActiveQuery('');

  try {
    const query = await generateQuery(question);

    if (query === undefined) {
      toast.error('An error occurred. Please try again.');
      setLoading(false);
      return;
    }

    setActiveQuery(query);
    setLoadingStep(2);

    const companies = await runGeneratedSQLQuery(query);
    const columns = companies.length > 0 ? Object.keys(companies[0]) : [];
    setResults(companies);
    setColumns(columns);

    setLoading(false);
  } catch (e) {
    toast.error('An error occurred. Please try again.');
    setLoading(false);
  }
};

/* ...rest of the file... */
```

Now, when the user submits a natural language query (ie. "how many unicorns are from San Francisco?"), that question will be sent to your newly created Server Action. The Server Action will call the model, passing in your system prompt and the users query, and return the generated SQL query in a structured format. This query is then passed to the `runGeneratedSQLQuery` action to run the query against your database. The results are then saved in local state and displayed to the user.

Save the file, make sure the dev server is running, and then head to `localhost:3000` in your browser. Try submitting a natural language query and see the generated SQL query and results. You should see a SQL query generated and displayed under the input field. You should also see the results of the query displayed in a table below the input field.

Try clicking the SQL query to see the full query if it's too long to display in the input field. You should see a button on the right side of the input field with a question mark icon. Clicking this button currently does nothing, but you'll add the "explain query" functionality to it in the next step.

## Explain SQL Queries

Next, let's add the ability to explain SQL queries in plain English. This feature helps users understand how the generated SQL query works by breaking it down into logical sections.
As with the SQL query generation, you'll need a prompt to guide the model when explaining queries.

Let's craft a prompt for the explain query functionality:

```txt
You are a SQL (postgres) expert. Your job is to explain to the user write a SQL query you wrote to retrieve the data they asked for. The table schema is as follows:
unicorns (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  company VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  valuation DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  date_joined DATE,
  country VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  city VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  industry VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  select_investors TEXT NOT NULL
);

When you explain you must take a section of the query, and then explain it. Each "section" should be unique. So in a query like: "SELECT * FROM unicorns limit 20", the sections could be "SELECT *", "FROM UNICORNS", "LIMIT 20".
If a section doesn't have any explanation, include it, but leave the explanation empty.
```

Like the prompt for generating SQL queries, you provide the model with the schema of the database. Additionally, you provide an example of what each section of the query might look like. This helps the model understand the structure of the query and how to break it down into logical sections.

### Create a Server Action

Add a new Server Action to generate explanations for SQL queries.

This action takes two parameters - the original natural language input and the generated SQL query.

```ts filename="app/actions.ts"
/* ...rest of the file... */

export const explainQuery = async (input: string, sqlQuery: string) => {
  'use server';
  try {
    const result = await generateObject({
      model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
      system: `You are a SQL (postgres) expert. ...`, // SYSTEM PROMPT AS ABOVE - OMITTED FOR BREVITY
      prompt: `Explain the SQL query you generated to retrieve the data the user wanted. Assume the user is not an expert in SQL. Break down the query into steps. Be concise.

      User Query:
      ${input}

      Generated SQL Query:
      ${sqlQuery}`,
    });
    return result.object;
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
    throw new Error('Failed to generate query');
  }
};
```

This action uses the `generateObject` function again. However, you haven't defined the schema yet. Let's define it in another file so it can also be used as a type in your components.

Update your `lib/types.ts` file to include the schema for the explanations:

```ts filename="lib/types.ts"
import { z } from 'zod';

/* ...rest of the file... */

export const explanationSchema = z.object({
  section: z.string(),
  explanation: z.string(),
});

export type QueryExplanation = z.infer<typeof explanationSchema>;
```

This schema defines the structure of the explanation that the model will generate. Each explanation will have a `section` and an `explanation`. The `section` is the part of the query being explained, and the `explanation` is the plain English explanation of that section. Go back to your `actions.ts` file and import and use the `explanationSchema`:

```ts filename="app/actions.ts" highlight="2,19,20"
// other imports
import { explanationSchema } from '@/lib/types';

/* ...rest of the file... */

export const explainQuery = async (input: string, sqlQuery: string) => {
  'use server';
  try {
    const result = await generateObject({
      model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
      system: `You are a SQL (postgres) expert. ...`, // SYSTEM PROMPT AS ABOVE - OMITTED FOR BREVITY
      prompt: `Explain the SQL query you generated to retrieve the data the user wanted. Assume the user is not an expert in SQL. Break down the query into steps. Be concise.

      User Query:
      ${input}

      Generated SQL Query:
      ${sqlQuery}`,
      schema: explanationSchema,
      output: 'array',
    });
    return result.object;
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
    throw new Error('Failed to generate query');
  }
};
```

<Note>
  You can use `output: "array"` to indicate to the model that you expect an
  array of objects matching the schema to be returned.
</Note>

### Update query viewer

Next, update the `query-viewer.tsx` component to display these explanations. The `handleExplainQuery` function is called every time the user clicks the question icon button on the right side of the query. Let's update this function to use the new `explainQuery` action:

```ts filename="components/query-viewer.tsx" highlight="2,10,11"
/* ...other imports... */
import { explainQuery } from '@/app/actions';

/* ...rest of the component... */

const handleExplainQuery = async () => {
  setQueryExpanded(true);
  setLoadingExplanation(true);

  const explanations = await explainQuery(inputValue, activeQuery);
  setQueryExplanations(explanations);

  setLoadingExplanation(false);
};

/* ...rest of the component... */
```

Now when users click the explanation button (the question mark icon), the component will:

1. Show a loading state
2. Send the active SQL query and the users natural language query to your Server Action
3. The model will generate an array of explanations
4. The explanations will be set in the component state and rendered in the UI

Submit a new query and then click the explanation button. Hover over different elements of the query. You should see the explanations for each section!

## Visualizing query results

Finally, let's render the query results visually in a chart. There are two approaches you could take:

1. Send both the query and data to the model and ask it to return the data in a visualization-ready format. While this provides complete control over the visualization, it requires the model to send back all of the data, which significantly increases latency and costs.

2. Send the query and data to the model and ask it to generate a chart configuration (fixed-size and not many tokens) that maps your data appropriately. This configuration specifies how to visualize the information while delivering the insights from your natural language query. Importantly, this is done without requiring the model return the full dataset.

Since you don't know the SQL query or data shape beforehand, let's use the second approach to dynamically generate chart configurations based on the query results and user intent.

### Generate the chart configuration

For this feature, you'll create a Server Action that takes the query results and the user's original natural language query to determine the best visualization approach. Your application is already set up to use `shadcn` charts (which uses [`Recharts`](https://recharts.org/en-US/) under the hood) so the model will need to generate:

- Chart type (bar, line, area, or pie)
- Axis mappings
- Visual styling

Let's start by defining the schema for the chart configuration in `lib/types.ts`:

```ts filename="lib/types.ts"
/* ...rest of the file... */

export const configSchema = z
  .object({
    description: z
      .string()
      .describe(
        'Describe the chart. What is it showing? What is interesting about the way the data is displayed?'
      ),
    takeaway: z.string().describe('What is the main takeaway from the chart?'),
    type: z.enum(['bar', 'line', 'area', 'pie']).describe('Type of chart'),
    title: z.string(),
    xKey: z.string().describe('Key for x-axis or category'),
    yKeys: z
      .array(z.string())
      .describe(
        'Key(s) for y-axis values this is typically the quantitative column'
      ),
    multipleLines: z
      .boolean()
      .describe(
        'For line charts only: whether the chart is comparing groups of data.'
      )
      .optional(),
    measurementColumn: z
      .string()
      .describe(
        'For line charts only: key for quantitative y-axis column to measure against (eg. values, counts etc.)'
      )
      .optional(),
    lineCategories: z
      .array(z.string())
      .describe(
        'For line charts only: Categories used to compare different lines or data series. Each category represents a distinct line in the chart.'
      )
      .optional(),
    colors: z
      .record(
        z.string().describe('Any of the yKeys'),
        z.string().describe('Color value in CSS format (e.g., hex, rgb, hsl)')
      )
      .describe('Mapping of data keys to color values for chart elements')
      .optional(),
    legend: z.boolean().describe('Whether to show legend'),
  })
  .describe('Chart configuration object');

export type Config = z.infer<typeof configSchema>;
```

<Note>
  Replace the existing `export type Config = any;` type with the new one.
</Note>

This schema makes extensive use of Zod's `.describe()` function to give the model extra context about each of the key's you are expecting in the chart configuration. This will help the model understand the purpose of each key and generate more accurate results.

Another important technique to note here is that you are defining `description` and `takeaway` fields. Not only are these useful for the user to quickly understand what the chart means and what they should take away from it, but they also force the model to generate a description of the data first, before it attempts to generate configuration attributes like axis and columns. This will help the model generate more accurate and relevant chart configurations.

### Create the Server Action

Create a new action in `app/actions.ts`:

```ts
/* ...other imports... */
import { Config, configSchema, explanationsSchema, Result } from '@/lib/types';

/* ...rest of the file... */

export const generateChartConfig = async (
  results: Result[],
  userQuery: string
) => {
  'use server';

  try {
    const { object: config } = await generateObject({
      model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
      system: 'You are a data visualization expert.',
      prompt: `Given the following data from a SQL query result, generate the chart config that best visualises the data and answers the users query.
      For multiple groups use multi-lines.

      Here is an example complete config:
      export const chartConfig = {
        type: "pie",
        xKey: "month",
        yKeys: ["sales", "profit", "expenses"],
        colors: {
          sales: "#4CAF50",    // Green for sales
          profit: "#2196F3",   // Blue for profit
          expenses: "#F44336"  // Red for expenses
        },
        legend: true
      }

      User Query:
      ${userQuery}

      Data:
      ${JSON.stringify(results, null, 2)}`,
      schema: configSchema,
    });

    // Override with shadcn theme colors
    const colors: Record<string, string> = {};
    config.yKeys.forEach((key, index) => {
      colors[key] = `hsl(var(--chart-${index + 1}))`;
    });

    const updatedConfig = { ...config, colors };
    return { config: updatedConfig };
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
    throw new Error('Failed to generate chart suggestion');
  }
};
```

### Update the chart component

With the action in place, you'll want to trigger it automatically after receiving query results. This ensures the visualization appears almost immediately after data loads.

Update the `handleSubmit` function in your root page (`app/page.tsx`) to generate and set the chart configuration after running the query:

```typescript filename="app/page.tsx" highlight="38,39"
/* ...other imports... */
import { getCompanies, generateQuery, generateChartConfig } from './actions';

/* ...rest of the file... */
const handleSubmit = async (suggestion?: string) => {
  clearExistingData();

  const question = suggestion ?? inputValue;
  if (inputValue.length === 0 && !suggestion) return;

  if (question.trim()) {
    setSubmitted(true);
  }

  setLoading(true);
  setLoadingStep(1);
  setActiveQuery('');

  try {
    const query = await generateQuery(question);

    if (query === undefined) {
      toast.error('An error occurred. Please try again.');
      setLoading(false);
      return;
    }

    setActiveQuery(query);
    setLoadingStep(2);

    const companies = await runGeneratedSQLQuery(query);
    const columns = companies.length > 0 ? Object.keys(companies[0]) : [];
    setResults(companies);
    setColumns(columns);

    setLoading(false);

    const { config } = await generateChartConfig(companies, question);
    setChartConfig(config);
  } catch (e) {
    toast.error('An error occurred. Please try again.');
    setLoading(false);
  }
};

/* ...rest of the file... */
```

Now when users submit queries, the application will:

1. Generate and run the SQL query
2. Display the table results
3. Generate a chart configuration for the results
4. Allow toggling between table and chart views

Head back to the browser and test the application with a few queries. You should see the chart visualization appear after the table results.

## Next steps

You've built an AI-powered SQL analysis tool that can convert natural language to SQL queries, visualize query results, and explain SQL queries in plain English.

You could, for example, extend the application to use your own data sources or add more advanced features like customizing the chart configuration schema to support more chart types and options. You could also add more complex SQL query generation capabilities.

# Get started with Computer Use

With the [release of Computer Use in Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use), you can now direct AI models to interact with computers like humans do - moving cursors, clicking buttons, and typing text. This capability enables automation of complex tasks while leveraging Claude's advanced reasoning abilities.

The AI SDK is a powerful TypeScript toolkit for building AI applications with large language models (LLMs) like Anthropic's Claude alongside popular frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more. In this guide, you will learn how to integrate Computer Use into your AI SDK applications.

<Note>
  Computer Use is currently in beta with some [ limitations
  ](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/computer-use#understand-computer-use-limitations).
  The feature may be error-prone at times. Anthropic recommends starting with
  low-risk tasks and implementing appropriate safety measures.
</Note>

## Computer Use

Anthropic recently released a new version of the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model which is capable of 'Computer Use'. This allows the model to interact with computer interfaces through basic actions like:

- Moving the cursor
- Clicking buttons
- Typing text
- Taking screenshots
- Reading screen content

## How It Works

Computer Use enables the model to read and interact with on-screen content through a series of coordinated steps. Here's how the process works:

1. **Start with a prompt and tools**

   Add Anthropic-defined Computer Use tools to your request and provide a task (prompt) for the model. For example: "save an image to your downloads folder."

2. **Select the right tool**

   The model evaluates which computer tools can help accomplish the task. It then sends a formatted `tool_call` to use the appropriate tool.

3. **Execute the action and return results**

   The AI SDK processes Claude's request by running the selected tool. The results can then be sent back to Claude through a `tool_result` message.

4. **Complete the task through iterations**

   Claude analyzes each result to determine if more actions are needed. It continues requesting tool use and processing results until it completes your task or requires additional input.

### Available Tools

There are three main tools available in the Computer Use API:

1. **Computer Tool**: Enables basic computer control like mouse movement, clicking, and keyboard input
2. **Text Editor Tool**: Provides functionality for viewing and editing text files
3. **Bash Tool**: Allows execution of bash commands

### Implementation Considerations

Computer Use tools in the AI SDK are predefined interfaces that require your own implementation of the execution layer. While the SDK provides the type definitions and structure for these tools, you need to:

1. Set up a controlled environment for Computer Use execution
2. Implement core functionality like mouse control and keyboard input
3. Handle screenshot capture and processing
4. Set up rules and limits for how Claude can interact with your system

The recommended approach is to start with [ Anthropic's reference implementation ](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/computer-use-demo), which provides:

- A containerized environment configured for safe Computer Use
- Ready-to-use (Python) implementations of Computer Use tools
- An agent loop for API interaction and tool execution
- A web interface for monitoring and control

This reference implementation serves as a foundation to understand the requirements before building your own custom solution.

## Getting Started with the AI SDK

<Note>
  If you have never used the AI SDK before, start by following the [Getting
  Started guide](/docs/getting-started).
</Note>

<Note>
  For a working example of Computer Use implementation with Next.js and the AI
  SDK, check out our [AI SDK Computer Use
  Template](https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai-sdk-computer-use).
</Note>

First, ensure you have the AI SDK and [Anthropic AI SDK provider](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/anthropic) installed:

<Snippet text="pnpm add ai @ai-sdk/anthropic" />

You can add Computer Use to your AI SDK applications using provider-defined-client tools. These tools accept various input parameters (like display height and width in the case of the computer tool) and then require that you define an execute function.

Here's how you could set up the Computer Tool with the AI SDK:

```ts
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { getScreenshot, executeComputerAction } from '@/utils/computer-use';

const computerTool = anthropic.tools.computer_20250124({
  displayWidthPx: 1920,
  displayHeightPx: 1080,
  execute: async ({ action, coordinate, text }) => {
    switch (action) {
      case 'screenshot': {
        return {
          type: 'image',
          data: getScreenshot(),
        };
      }
      default: {
        return executeComputerAction(action, coordinate, text);
      }
    }
  },
  toModelOutput(result) {
    return typeof result === 'string'
      ? [{ type: 'text', text: result }]
      : [{ type: 'image', data: result.data, mediaType: 'image/png' }];
  },
});
```

The `computerTool` handles two main actions: taking screenshots via `getScreenshot()` and executing computer actions like mouse movements and clicks through `executeComputerAction()`. Remember, you have to implement this execution logic (eg. the `getScreenshot` and `executeComputerAction` functions) to handle the actual computer interactions. The `execute` function should handle all low-level interactions with the operating system.

Finally, to send tool results back to the model, use the [`toModelOutput()`](/docs/foundations/prompts#multi-modal-tool-results) function to convert text and image responses into a format the model can process. The AI SDK includes experimental support for these multi-modal tool results when using Anthropic's models.

<Note>
  Computer Use requires appropriate safety measures like using virtual machines,
  limiting access to sensitive data, and implementing human oversight for
  critical actions.
</Note>

### Using Computer Tools with Text Generation

Once your tool is defined, you can use it with both the [`generateText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-text) and [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text) functions.

For one-shot text generation, use `generateText`:

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
  prompt: 'Move the cursor to the center of the screen and take a screenshot',
  tools: { computer: computerTool },
});

console.log(result.text);
```

For streaming responses, use `streamText` to receive updates in real-time:

```ts
const result = streamText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
  prompt: 'Open the browser and navigate to vercel.com',
  tools: { computer: computerTool },
});

for await (const chunk of result.textStream) {
  console.log(chunk);
}
```

### Configure Multi-Step (Agentic) Generations

To allow the model to perform multiple steps without user intervention, use the `stopWhen` parameter. This will automatically send any tool results back to the model to trigger a subsequent generation:

```ts highlight="1,7"
import { stepCountIs } from 'ai';

const stream = streamText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
  prompt: 'Open the browser and navigate to vercel.com',
  tools: { computer: computerTool },
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(10), // experiment with this value based on your use case
});
```

### Combine Multiple Tools

You can combine multiple tools in a single request to enable more complex workflows. The AI SDK supports all three of Claude's Computer Use tools:

```ts
const computerTool = anthropic.tools.computer_20250124({
  ...
});

const bashTool = anthropic.tools.bash_20250124({
  execute: async ({ command, restart }) => execSync(command).toString()
});

const textEditorTool = anthropic.tools.textEditor_20250124({
  execute: async ({
    command,
    path,
    file_text,
    insert_line,
    new_str,
    old_str,
    view_range
  }) => {
    // Handle file operations based on command
    switch(command) {
      return executeTextEditorFunction({
        command,
        path,
        fileText: file_text,
        insertLine: insert_line,
        newStr: new_str,
        oldStr: old_str,
        viewRange: view_range
      });
    }
  }
});


const response = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
  prompt: "Create a new file called example.txt, write 'Hello World' to it, and run 'cat example.txt' in the terminal",
  tools: {
    computer: computerTool,
    bash: bashTool,
    str_replace_editor: textEditorTool,
  },
});
```

<Note>
  Always implement appropriate [security measures](#security-measures) and
  obtain user consent before enabling Computer Use in production applications.
</Note>

### Best Practices for Computer Use

To get the best results when using Computer Use:

1. Specify simple, well-defined tasks with explicit instructions for each step
2. Prompt Claude to verify outcomes through screenshots
3. Use keyboard shortcuts when UI elements are difficult to manipulate
4. Include example screenshots for repeatable tasks
5. Provide explicit tips in system prompts for known tasks

## Security Measures

Remember, Computer Use is a beta feature. Please be aware that it poses unique risks that are distinct from standard API features or chat interfaces. These risks are heightened when using Computer Use to interact with the internet. To minimize risks, consider taking precautions such as:

1. Use a dedicated virtual machine or container with minimal privileges to prevent direct system attacks or accidents.
2. Avoid giving the model access to sensitive data, such as account login information, to prevent information theft.
3. Limit internet access to an allowlist of domains to reduce exposure to malicious content.
4. Ask a human to confirm decisions that may result in meaningful real-world consequences as well as any tasks requiring affirmative consent, such as accepting cookies, executing financial transactions, or agreeing to terms of service.

# Get started with Gemini 3

With the release of Gemini 3, Google's most intelligent model to date, there has never been a better time to start building AI applications that combine state-of-the-art reasoning with multimodal understanding.

The [AI SDK](/) is a powerful TypeScript toolkit for building AI applications with large language models (LLMs) like Gemini 3 alongside popular frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more.

## Gemini 3

Gemini 3 represents a significant leap forward in AI capabilities, combining all of Gemini's strengths together to help you bring any idea to life. It delivers:

- State-of-the-art reasoning with unprecedented depth and nuance
- PhD-level performance on complex benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam (37.5%) and GPQA Diamond (91.9%)
- Leading multimodal understanding with 81% on MMMU-Pro and 87.6% on Video-MMMU
- Best-in-class vibe coding and agentic capabilities
- Superior long-horizon planning for multi-step workflows

Gemini 3 Pro is currently available in preview, offering great performance across all benchmarks.

## Getting Started with the AI SDK

The AI SDK is the TypeScript toolkit designed to help developers build AI-powered applications with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more. Integrating LLMs into applications is complicated and heavily dependent on the specific model provider you use.

The AI SDK abstracts away the differences between model providers, eliminates boilerplate code for building chatbots, and allows you to go beyond text output to generate rich, interactive components.

At the center of the AI SDK is [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core/overview), which provides a unified API to call any LLM. The code snippet below is all you need to call Gemini 3 with the AI SDK:

```ts
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: google('gemini-3-pro-preview'),
  prompt: 'Explain the concept of the Hilbert space.',
});
console.log(text);
```

### Enhanced Reasoning with Thinking Mode

Gemini 3 Pro can use enhanced reasoning through thinking mode, which improves its ability to solve complex problems. You can control the thinking level using the `thinkingLevel` provider option:

```ts
import { google, GoogleGenerativeAIProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: google('gemini-3-pro-preview'),
  prompt: 'What is the sum of the first 10 prime numbers?',
  providerOptions: {
    google: {
      thinkingConfig: {
        includeThoughts: true,
        thinkingLevel: 'low',
      },
    } satisfies GoogleGenerativeAIProviderOptions,
  },
});

console.log(text);
```

The `thinkingLevel` parameter accepts values like `'low'` or `'high'` to control the depth of reasoning applied to your prompt.

### Using Tools with the AI SDK

Gemini 3 excels at tool calling with improved reliability and consistency for multi-step workflows. Here's an example of using tool calling with the AI SDK:

```ts
import { z } from 'zod';
import { generateText, tool, stepCountIs } from 'ai';
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';

const result = await generateText({
  model: google('gemini-3-pro-preview'),
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco?',
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
  },
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(5), // enables multi-step calling
});

console.log(result.text);

console.log(result.steps);
```

### Using Google Search with Gemini

With [search grounding](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/google-search), Gemini can access the latest information using Google search. Here's an example of using Google Search with the AI SDK:

```ts
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { GoogleGenerativeAIProviderMetadata } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, sources, providerMetadata } = await generateText({
  model: google('gemini-3-pro-preview'),
  tools: {
    google_search: google.tools.googleSearch({}),
  },
  prompt:
    'List the top 5 San Francisco news from the past week.' +
    'You must include the date of each article.',
});

// access the grounding metadata. Casting to the provider metadata type
// is optional but provides autocomplete and type safety.
const metadata = providerMetadata?.google as
  | GoogleGenerativeAIProviderMetadata
  | undefined;
const groundingMetadata = metadata?.groundingMetadata;
const safetyRatings = metadata?.safetyRatings;

console.log({ text, sources, groundingMetadata, safetyRatings });
```

### Building Interactive Interfaces

AI SDK Core can be paired with [AI SDK UI](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/overview), another powerful component of the AI SDK, to streamline the process of building chat, completion, and assistant interfaces with popular frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, and SolidStart.

AI SDK UI provides robust abstractions that simplify the complex tasks of managing chat streams and UI updates on the frontend, enabling you to develop dynamic AI-driven interfaces more efficiently.

With four main hooks — [`useChat`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat), [`useCompletion`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-completion), [`useObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-object), and [`useAssistant`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-assistant) — you can incorporate real-time chat capabilities, text completions, streamed JSON, and interactive assistant features into your app.

Let's explore building a chatbot with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), the AI SDK, and Gemini 3 Pro:

In a new Next.js application, first install the AI SDK and the Google Generative AI provider:

<Snippet text="pnpm install ai @ai-sdk/google" />

Then, create a route handler for the chat endpoint:

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts"
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { streamText, UIMessage, convertToModelMessages } from 'ai';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: google('gemini-3-pro-preview'),
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

Finally, update the root page (`app/page.tsx`) to use the `useChat` hook:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Chat() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat();
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col w-full max-w-md py-24 mx-auto stretch">
      {messages.map((message) => (
        <div key={message.id} className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
          {message.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'Gemini: '}
          {message.parts.map((part, i) => {
            switch (part.type) {
              case 'text':
                return <div key={`${message.id}-${i}`}>{part.text}</div>;
            }
          })}
        </div>
      ))}

      <form
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          sendMessage({ text: input });
          setInput('');
        }}
      >
        <input
          className="fixed dark:bg-zinc-900 bottom-0 w-full max-w-md p-2 mb-8 border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-800 rounded shadow-xl"
          value={input}
          placeholder="Say something..."
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.currentTarget.value)}
        />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The useChat hook on your root page (`app/page.tsx`) will make a request to your AI provider endpoint (`app/api/chat/route.ts`) whenever the user submits a message. The messages are then displayed in the chat UI.

# Get started with Claude 4

With the release of Claude 4, there has never been a better time to start building AI applications, particularly those that require complex reasoning capabilities and advanced intelligence.

The [AI SDK](/) is a powerful TypeScript toolkit for building AI applications with large language models (LLMs) like Claude 4 alongside popular frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more.

## Claude 4

Claude 4 is Anthropic's most advanced model family to date, offering exceptional capabilities across reasoning, instruction following, coding, and knowledge tasks. Available in two variants—Sonnet and Opus—Claude 4 delivers state-of-the-art performance with enhanced reliability and control. Claude 4 builds on the extended thinking capabilities introduced in Claude 3.7, allowing for even more sophisticated problem-solving through careful, step-by-step reasoning.

Claude 4 excels at complex reasoning, code generation and analysis, detailed content creation, and agentic capabilities, making it ideal for powering sophisticated AI workflows, customer-facing agents, and applications requiring nuanced understanding and responses. Claude Opus 4 is an excellent coding model, leading on SWE-bench (72.5%) and Terminal-bench (43.2%), with the ability to sustain performance on long-running tasks that require focused effort and thousands of steps. Claude Sonnet 4 significantly improves on Sonnet 3.7, excelling in coding with 72.7% on SWE-bench while balancing performance and efficiency.

### Prompt Engineering for Claude 4 Models

Claude 4 models respond well to clear, explicit instructions. The following best practices can help achieve optimal performance:

1. **Provide explicit instructions**: Clearly state what you want the model to do, including specific steps or formats for the response.
2. **Include context and motivation**: Explain why a task is being performed to help the model better understand the underlying goals.
3. **Avoid negative examples**: When providing examples, only demonstrate the behavior you want to see, not what you want to avoid.

## Getting Started with the AI SDK

The AI SDK is the TypeScript toolkit designed to help developers build AI-powered applications with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more. Integrating LLMs into applications is complicated and heavily dependent on the specific model provider you use.

The AI SDK abstracts away the differences between model providers, eliminates boilerplate code for building chatbots, and allows you to go beyond text output to generate rich, interactive components.

At the center of the AI SDK is [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core/overview), which provides a unified API to call any LLM. The code snippet below is all you need to call Claude 4 Sonnet with the AI SDK:

```ts
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, reasoningText, reasoning } = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-sonnet-4-20250514'),
  prompt: 'How will quantum computing impact cryptography by 2050?',
});
console.log(text);
```

### Reasoning Ability

Claude 4 enhances the extended thinking capabilities first introduced in Claude 3.7 Sonnet—the ability to solve complex problems with careful, step-by-step reasoning. Additionally, both Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 can now use tools during extended thinking, allowing Claude to alternate between reasoning and tool use to improve responses. You can enable extended thinking using the `thinking` provider option and specifying a thinking budget in tokens. For interleaved thinking (where Claude can think in between tool calls) you'll need to enable a beta feature using the `anthropic-beta` header:

```ts
import { anthropic, AnthropicProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, reasoningText, reasoning } = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-sonnet-4-20250514'),
  prompt: 'How will quantum computing impact cryptography by 2050?',
  providerOptions: {
    anthropic: {
      thinking: { type: 'enabled', budgetTokens: 15000 },
    } satisfies AnthropicProviderOptions,
  },
  headers: {
    'anthropic-beta': 'interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14',
  },
});

console.log(text); // text response
console.log(reasoningText); // reasoning text
console.log(reasoning); // reasoning details including redacted reasoning
```

### Building Interactive Interfaces

AI SDK Core can be paired with [AI SDK UI](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/overview), another powerful component of the AI SDK, to streamline the process of building chat, completion, and assistant interfaces with popular frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, and SolidStart.

AI SDK UI provides robust abstractions that simplify the complex tasks of managing chat streams and UI updates on the frontend, enabling you to develop dynamic AI-driven interfaces more efficiently.

Let's explore building a chatbot with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), the AI SDK, and Claude Sonnet 4:

In a new Next.js application, first install the AI SDK and the Anthropic provider:

<Snippet text="pnpm install ai @ai-sdk/anthropic" />

Then, create a route handler for the chat endpoint:

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts"
import { anthropic, AnthropicProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { streamText, convertToModelMessages, type UIMessage } from 'ai';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: anthropic('claude-sonnet-4-20250514'),
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
    headers: {
      'anthropic-beta': 'interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14',
    },
    providerOptions: {
      anthropic: {
        thinking: { type: 'enabled', budgetTokens: 15000 },
      } satisfies AnthropicProviderOptions,
    },
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse({
    sendReasoning: true,
  });
}
```

<Note>
  You can forward the model's reasoning tokens to the client with
  `sendReasoning: true` in the `toUIMessageStreamResponse` method.
</Note>

Finally, update the root page (`app/page.tsx`) to use the `useChat` hook:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { DefaultChatTransport } from 'ai';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Page() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat({
    transport: new DefaultChatTransport({ api: '/api/chat' }),
  });

  const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (input.trim()) {
      sendMessage({ text: input });
      setInput('');
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col h-screen max-w-2xl mx-auto p-4">
      <div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto space-y-4 mb-4">
        {messages.map((message) => (
          <div
            key={message.id}
            className={`p-3 rounded-lg ${
              message.role === 'user' ? 'bg-blue-50 ml-auto' : 'bg-gray-50'
            }`}
          >
            <p className="font-semibold">
              {message.role === 'user' ? 'You' : 'Claude 4'}
            </p>
            {message.parts.map((part, index) => {
              if (part.type === 'text') {
                return (
                  <div key={index} className="mt-1">
                    {part.text}
                  </div>
                );
              }
              if (part.type === 'reasoning') {
                return (
                  <pre
                    key={index}
                    className="bg-gray-100 p-2 rounded mt-2 text-xs overflow-x-auto"
                  >
                    <details>
                      <summary className="cursor-pointer">
                        View reasoning
                      </summary>
                      {part.text}
                    </details>
                  </pre>
                );
              }
            })}
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className="flex gap-2">
        <input
          name="prompt"
          value={input}
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
          className="flex-1 p-2 border rounded focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500"
          placeholder="Ask Claude 4 something..."
        />
        <button
          type="submit"
          className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded hover:bg-blue-600"
        >
          Send
        </button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Note>
  You can access the model's reasoning tokens with the `reasoning` part on the
  message `parts`. The reasoning text is available in the `text` property of the
  reasoning part.
</Note>

The useChat hook on your root page (`app/page.tsx`) will make a request to your LLM provider endpoint (`app/api/chat/route.ts`) whenever the user submits a message. The messages are then displayed in the chat UI.

### Claude 4 Model Variants

Claude 4 is available in two variants, each optimized for different use cases:

- **Claude Sonnet 4**: Balanced performance suitable for most enterprise applications, with significant improvements over Sonnet 3.7.
- **Claude Opus 4**: Anthropic's most powerful model and the best coding model available. Excels at sustained performance on long-running tasks that require focused effort and thousands of steps, with the ability to work continuously for several hours.

# Get started with OpenAI Responses API

With the [release of OpenAI's responses API](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/), there has never been a better time to start building AI applications, particularly those that require a deeper understanding of the world.

The [AI SDK](/) is a powerful TypeScript toolkit for building AI applications with large language models (LLMs) alongside popular frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more.

## OpenAI Responses API

OpenAI recently released the Responses API, a brand new way to build applications on OpenAI's platform. The new API offers a way to persist chat history, a web search tool for grounding LLM responses, file search tool for finding relevant files, and a computer use tool for building agents that can interact with and operate computers. Let's explore how to use the Responses API with the AI SDK.

## Getting Started with the AI SDK

The AI SDK is the TypeScript toolkit designed to help developers build AI-powered applications with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more. Integrating LLMs into applications is complicated and heavily dependent on the specific model provider you use.

The AI SDK abstracts away the differences between model providers, eliminates boilerplate code for building chatbots, and allows you to go beyond text output to generate rich, interactive components.

At the center of the AI SDK is [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core/overview), which provides a unified API to call any LLM. The code snippet below is all you need to call GPT-4o with the new Responses API using the AI SDK:

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai.responses('gpt-4o'),
  prompt: 'Explain the concept of quantum entanglement.',
});
```

### Generating Structured Data

While text generation can be useful, you might want to generate structured JSON data. For example, you might want to extract information from text, classify data, or generate synthetic data. AI SDK Core provides two functions ([`generateObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-object) and [`streamObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-object)) to generate structured data, allowing you to constrain model outputs to a specific schema.

```ts
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const { object } = await generateObject({
  model: openai.responses('gpt-4o'),
  schema: z.object({
    recipe: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      ingredients: z.array(z.object({ name: z.string(), amount: z.string() })),
      steps: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});
```

This code snippet will generate a type-safe recipe that conforms to the specified zod schema.

### Using Tools with the AI SDK

The Responses API supports tool calling out of the box, allowing it to interact with external systems and perform discrete tasks. Here's an example of using tool calling with the AI SDK:

```ts
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai.responses('gpt-4o'),
  prompt: 'What is the weather like today in San Francisco?',
  tools: {
    getWeather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
  },
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(5), // enable multi-step 'agentic' LLM calls
});
```

This example demonstrates how `stopWhen` transforms a single LLM call into an agent. The `stopWhen: stepCountIs(5)` parameter allows the model to autonomously call tools, analyze results, and make additional tool calls as needed - turning what would be a simple one-shot completion into an intelligent agent that can chain multiple actions together to complete complex tasks.

### Web Search Tool

The Responses API introduces a built-in tool for grounding responses called `webSearch`. With this tool, the model can access the internet to find relevant information for its responses.

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai.responses('gpt-4o-mini'),
  prompt: 'What happened in San Francisco last week?',
  tools: {
    web_search_preview: openai.tools.webSearchPreview(),
  },
});

console.log(result.text);
console.log(result.sources);
```

The `webSearch` tool also allows you to specify query-specific metadata that can be used to improve the quality of the search results.

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai.responses('gpt-4o-mini'),
  prompt: 'What happened in San Francisco last week?',
  tools: {
    web_search_preview: openai.tools.webSearchPreview({
      searchContextSize: 'high',
      userLocation: {
        type: 'approximate',
        city: 'San Francisco',
        region: 'California',
      },
    }),
  },
});

console.log(result.text);
console.log(result.sources);
```

### MCP Tool

The Responses API also supports connecting to [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers. This allows models to call tools exposed by remote MCP servers or service connectors.

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai.responses('gpt-5-mini'),
  prompt: 'Search the web for the latest NYC mayoral election results',
  tools: {
    mcp: openai.tools.mcp({
      serverLabel: 'web-search',
      serverUrl: 'https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp',
      serverDescription: 'A web-search API for AI agents',
    }),
  },
});

console.log(result.text);
```

For more details on configuring the MCP tool, including authentication, tool filtering, and connector support, see the [OpenAI provider documentation](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/openai#mcp-tool).

## Using Persistence

With the Responses API, you can persist chat history with OpenAI across requests. This allows you to send just the user's last message and OpenAI can access the entire chat history.

There are two options available to use persistence:

### With previousResponseId

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result1 = await generateText({
  model: openai.responses('gpt-4o-mini'),
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
});

const result2 = await generateText({
  model: openai.responses('gpt-4o-mini'),
  prompt: 'Summarize in 2 sentences',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      previousResponseId: result1.providerMetadata?.openai.responseId as string,
    },
  },
});
```

### With Conversations

You can use the [Conversation API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/conversations/create) to create a conversation.

Once you have created a conversation, you can continue it:

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai.responses('gpt-4o-mini'),
  prompt: 'Summarize in 2 sentences',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      // The Conversation ID created via the OpenAI API to continue
      conversation: 'conv_123',
    },
  },
});
```

## Migrating from Completions API

Migrating from the OpenAI Completions API (via the AI SDK) to the new Responses API is simple. To migrate, simply change your provider instance from `openai(modelId)` to `openai.responses(modelId)`:

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

// Completions API
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
  prompt: 'Explain the concept of quantum entanglement.',
});

// Responses API
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai.responses('gpt-4o'),
  prompt: 'Explain the concept of quantum entanglement.',
});
```

When using the Responses API, provider specific options that were previously specified on the model provider instance have now moved to the `providerOptions` object:

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

// Completions API
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
  prompt: 'Explain the concept of quantum entanglement.',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      parallelToolCalls: false,
    },
  },
});

// Responses API
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai.responses('gpt-4o'),
  prompt: 'Explain the concept of quantum entanglement.',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      parallelToolCalls: false,
    },
  },
});
```

# Generate and Edit Images with Google Gemini 2.5 Flash

This guide will show you how to generate and edit images with the AI SDK and Google's latest multimodal language model Gemini 2.5 Flash Image.

## Generating Images

As Gemini 2.5 Flash Image is a language model with multimodal capabilities, you can use the `generateText` or `streamText` functions (not `generateImage`) to create images. The model determines which modality to respond in based on your prompt and configuration. Here's how to create your first image:

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import fs from 'node:fs';
import 'dotenv/config';

async function generateImage() {
  const result = await generateText({
    model: 'google/gemini-2.5-flash-image',
    prompt:
      'Create a picture of a nano banana dish in a fancy restaurant with a Gemini theme',
  });

  // Save generated images
  for (const file of result.files) {
    if (file.mediaType.startsWith('image/')) {
      const timestamp = Date.now();
      const fileName = `generated-${timestamp}.png`;

      fs.mkdirSync('output', { recursive: true });
      await fs.promises.writeFile(`output/${fileName}`, file.uint8Array);

      console.log(`Generated and saved image: output/${fileName}`);
    }
  }
}

generateImage().catch(console.error);
```

Here are some key points to remember:

- Generated images are returned in the `result.files` array
- Images are returned as `Uint8Array` data
- The model leverages Gemini's world knowledge, so detailed prompts yield better results

## Editing Images

Gemini 2.5 Flash Image excels at editing existing images with natural language instructions. You can add elements, modify styles, or transform images while maintaining their core characteristics:

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import fs from 'node:fs';
import 'dotenv/config';

async function editImage() {
  const editResult = await generateText({
    model: 'google/gemini-2.5-flash-image',
    prompt: [
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: [
          {
            type: 'text',
            text: 'Add a small wizard hat to this cat. Keep everything else the same.',
          },
          {
            type: 'image',
            // image: DataContent (string | Uint8Array | ArrayBuffer | Buffer) or URL
            image: new URL(
              'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vercel/ai/refs/heads/main/examples/ai-core/data/comic-cat.png'
            ),
            mediaType: 'image/jpeg',
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  });

  // Save the edited image
  const timestamp = Date.now();
  fs.mkdirSync('output', { recursive: true });

  for (const file of editResult.files) {
    if (file.mediaType.startsWith('image/')) {
      await fs.promises.writeFile(
        `output/edited-${timestamp}.png`,
        file.uint8Array
      );
      console.log(`Saved edited image: output/edited-${timestamp}.png`);
    }
  }
}

editImage().catch(console.error);
```

# Get started with Claude 3.7 Sonnet

With the [release of Claude 3.7 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet), there has never been a better time to start building AI applications, particularly those that require complex reasoning capabilities.

The [AI SDK](/) is a powerful TypeScript toolkit for building AI applications with large language models (LLMs) like Claude 3.7 Sonnet alongside popular frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more.

## Claude 3.7 Sonnet

Claude 3.7 Sonnet is Anthropic's most intelligent model to date and the first Claude model to offer extended thinking—the ability to solve complex problems with careful, step-by-step reasoning. With Claude 3.7 Sonnet, you can balance speed and quality by choosing between standard thinking for near-instant responses or extended thinking or advanced reasoning. Claude 3.7 Sonnet is state-of-the-art for coding, and delivers advancements in computer use, agentic capabilities, complex reasoning, and content generation. With frontier performance and more control over speed, Claude 3.7 Sonnet is a great choice for powering AI agents, especially customer-facing agents, and complex AI workflows.

## Getting Started with the AI SDK

The AI SDK is the TypeScript toolkit designed to help developers build AI-powered applications with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more. Integrating LLMs into applications is complicated and heavily dependent on the specific model provider you use.

The AI SDK abstracts away the differences between model providers, eliminates boilerplate code for building chatbots, and allows you to go beyond text output to generate rich, interactive components.

At the center of the AI SDK is [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core/overview), which provides a unified API to call any LLM. The code snippet below is all you need to call Claude 3.7 Sonnet with the AI SDK:

```ts
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, reasoning, reasoningDetails } = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219'),
  prompt: 'How many people will live in the world in 2040?',
});
console.log(text); // text response
```

The unified interface also means that you can easily switch between providers by changing just two lines of code. For example, to use Claude 3.7 Sonnet via Amazon Bedrock:

```ts
import { bedrock } from '@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { reasoning, text } = await generateText({
  model: bedrock('anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0'),
  prompt: 'How many people will live in the world in 2040?',
});
```

### Reasoning Ability

Claude 3.7 Sonnet introduces a new extended thinking—the ability to solve complex problems with careful, step-by-step reasoning. You can enable it using the `thinking` provider option and specifying a thinking budget in tokens:

```ts
import { anthropic, AnthropicProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, reasoning, reasoningDetails } = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219'),
  prompt: 'How many people will live in the world in 2040?',
  providerOptions: {
    anthropic: {
      thinking: { type: 'enabled', budgetTokens: 12000 },
    } satisfies AnthropicProviderOptions,
  },
});

console.log(reasoning); // reasoning text
console.log(reasoningDetails); // reasoning details including redacted reasoning
console.log(text); // text response
```

### Building Interactive Interfaces

AI SDK Core can be paired with [AI SDK UI](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/overview), another powerful component of the AI SDK, to streamline the process of building chat, completion, and assistant interfaces with popular frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt, and SvelteKit.

AI SDK UI provides robust abstractions that simplify the complex tasks of managing chat streams and UI updates on the frontend, enabling you to develop dynamic AI-driven interfaces more efficiently.

With four main hooks — [`useChat`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat), [`useCompletion`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-completion), and [`useObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-object) — you can incorporate real-time chat capabilities, text completions, streamed JSON, and interactive assistant features into your app.

Let's explore building a chatbot with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), the AI SDK, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet:

In a new Next.js application, first install the AI SDK and the Anthropic provider:

<Snippet text="pnpm install ai @ai-sdk/anthropic" />

Then, create a route handler for the chat endpoint:

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts"
import { anthropic, AnthropicProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { streamText, convertToModelMessages, type UIMessage } from 'ai';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: anthropic('claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219'),
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
    providerOptions: {
      anthropic: {
        thinking: { type: 'enabled', budgetTokens: 12000 },
      } satisfies AnthropicProviderOptions,
    },
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse({
    sendReasoning: true,
  });
}
```

<Note>
  You can forward the model's reasoning tokens to the client with
  `sendReasoning: true` in the `toUIMessageStreamResponse` method.
</Note>

Finally, update the root page (`app/page.tsx`) to use the `useChat` hook:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { DefaultChatTransport } from 'ai';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Page() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat({
    transport: new DefaultChatTransport({ api: '/api/chat' }),
  });

  const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (input.trim()) {
      sendMessage({ text: input });
      setInput('');
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      {messages.map((message) => (
        <div key={message.id}>
          {message.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
          {message.parts.map((part, index) => {
            // text parts:
            if (part.type === 'text') {
              return <div key={index}>{part.text}</div>;
            }
            // reasoning parts:
            if (part.type === 'reasoning') {
              return <pre key={index}>{part.text}</pre>;
            }
          })}
        </div>
      ))}
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          name="prompt"
          value={input}
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    </>
  );
}
```

<Note>
  You can access the model's reasoning tokens with the `reasoning` part on the
  message `parts`.
</Note>

The useChat hook on your root page (`app/page.tsx`) will make a request to your LLM provider endpoint (`app/api/chat/route.ts`) whenever the user submits a message. The messages are then displayed in the chat UI.

# Get started with Llama 3.1

<Note>
  The current generation of Llama models is 3.3. Please note that while this
  guide focuses on Llama 3.1, the newer Llama 3.3 models are now available and
  may offer improved capabilities. The concepts and integration techniques
  described here remain applicable, though you may want to use the latest
  generation models for optimal performance.
</Note>

With the [release of Llama 3.1](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/), there has never been a better time to start building AI applications.

The [AI SDK](/) is a powerful TypeScript toolkit for building AI application with large language models (LLMs) like Llama 3.1 alongside popular frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more

## Llama 3.1

The release of Meta's Llama 3.1 is an important moment in AI development. As the first state-of-the-art open weight AI model, Llama 3.1 is helping accelerate developers building AI apps. Available in 8B, 70B, and 405B sizes, these instruction-tuned models work well for tasks like dialogue generation, translation, reasoning, and code generation.

## Benchmarks

Llama 3.1 surpasses most available open-source chat models on common industry benchmarks and even outperforms some closed-source models, offering superior performance in language nuances, contextual understanding, and complex multi-step tasks. The models' refined post-training processes significantly improve response alignment, reduce false refusal rates, and enhance answer diversity, making Llama 3.1 a powerful and accessible tool for building generative AI applications.

![Llama 3.1 Benchmarks](/images/llama-3_1-benchmarks.png)
Source: [Meta AI - Llama 3.1 Model Card](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-models/blob/main/models/llama3_1/MODEL_CARD.md)

## Choosing Model Size

Llama 3.1 includes a new 405B parameter model, becoming the largest open-source model available today. This model is designed to handle the most complex and demanding tasks.

When choosing between the different sizes of Llama 3.1 models (405B, 70B, 8B), consider the trade-off between performance and computational requirements. The 405B model offers the highest accuracy and capability for complex tasks but requires significant computational resources. The 70B model provides a good balance of performance and efficiency for most applications, while the 8B model is suitable for simpler tasks or resource-constrained environments where speed and lower computational overhead are priorities.

## Getting Started with the AI SDK

The AI SDK is the TypeScript toolkit designed to help developers build AI-powered applications with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more. Integrating LLMs into applications is complicated and heavily dependent on the specific model provider you use.

The AI SDK abstracts away the differences between model providers, eliminates boilerplate code for building chatbots, and allows you to go beyond text output to generate rich, interactive components.

At the center of the AI SDK is [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core/overview), which provides a unified API to call any LLM. The code snippet below is all you need to call Llama 3.1 (using [DeepInfra](https://deepinfra.com)) with the AI SDK:

```ts
import { deepinfra } from '@ai-sdk/deepinfra';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: deepinfra('meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct'),
  prompt: 'What is love?',
});
```

<Note>
  Llama 3.1 is available to use with many AI SDK providers including
  [DeepInfra](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/deepinfra), [Amazon
  Bedrock](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/amazon-bedrock),
  [Baseten](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/baseten)
  [Fireworks](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/fireworks), and more.
</Note>

AI SDK Core abstracts away the differences between model providers, allowing you to focus on building great applications. Prefer to use [Amazon Bedrock](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/amazon-bedrock)? The unified interface also means that you can easily switch between models by changing just two lines of code.

```tsx highlight="2,5"
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { bedrock } from '@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: bedrock('meta.llama3-1-405b-instruct-v1'),
  prompt: 'What is love?',
});
```

### Streaming the Response

To stream the model's response as it's being generated, update your code snippet to use the [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text) function.

```tsx
import { streamText } from 'ai';
import { deepinfra } from '@ai-sdk/deepinfra';

const { textStream } = streamText({
  model: deepinfra('meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct'),
  prompt: 'What is love?',
});
```

### Generating Structured Data

While text generation can be useful, you might want to generate structured JSON data. For example, you might want to extract information from text, classify data, or generate synthetic data. AI SDK Core provides two functions ([`generateObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-object) and [`streamObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-object)) to generate structured data, allowing you to constrain model outputs to a specific schema.

```ts
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { deepinfra } from '@ai-sdk/deepinfra';
import { z } from 'zod';

const { object } = await generateObject({
  model: deepinfra('meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct'),
  schema: z.object({
    recipe: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      ingredients: z.array(z.object({ name: z.string(), amount: z.string() })),
      steps: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});
```

This code snippet will generate a type-safe recipe that conforms to the specified zod schema.

### Tools

While LLMs have incredible generation capabilities, they struggle with discrete tasks (e.g. mathematics) and interacting with the outside world (e.g. getting the weather). The solution: tools, which are like programs that you provide to the model, which it can choose to call as necessary.

### Using Tools with the AI SDK

The AI SDK supports tool usage across several of its functions, including [`generateText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-text) and [`streamUI`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-rsc/stream-ui). By passing one or more tools to the `tools` parameter, you can extend the capabilities of LLMs, allowing them to perform discrete tasks and interact with external systems.

Here's an example of how you can use a tool with the AI SDK and Llama 3.1:

```ts
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';
import { deepinfra } from '@ai-sdk/deepinfra';
import { z } from 'zod';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: deepinfra('meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct'),
  prompt: 'What is the weather like today?',
  tools: {
    getWeather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
  },
});
```

In this example, the `getWeather` tool allows the model to fetch real-time weather data, enhancing its ability to provide accurate and up-to-date information.

### Agents

Agents take your AI applications a step further by allowing models to execute multiple steps (i.e. tools) in a non-deterministic way, making decisions based on context and user input.

Agents use LLMs to choose the next step in a problem-solving process. They can reason at each step and make decisions based on the evolving context.

### Implementing Agents with the AI SDK

The AI SDK supports agent implementation through the `maxSteps` parameter. This allows the model to make multiple decisions and tool calls in a single interaction.

Here's an example of an agent that solves math problems:

```tsx
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';
import { deepinfra } from '@ai-sdk/deepinfra';
import * as mathjs from 'mathjs';
import { z } from 'zod';

const problem =
  'Calculate the profit for a day if revenue is $5000 and expenses are $3500.';

const { text: answer } = await generateText({
  model: deepinfra('meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct'),
  system:
    'You are solving math problems. Reason step by step. Use the calculator when necessary.',
  prompt: problem,
  tools: {
    calculate: tool({
      description: 'A tool for evaluating mathematical expressions.',
      inputSchema: z.object({ expression: z.string() }),
      execute: async ({ expression }) => mathjs.evaluate(expression),
    }),
  },
  maxSteps: 5,
});
```

In this example, the agent can use the calculator tool multiple times if needed, reasoning through the problem step by step.

### Building Interactive Interfaces

AI SDK Core can be paired with [AI SDK UI](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/overview), another powerful component of the AI SDK, to streamline the process of building chat, completion, and assistant interfaces with popular frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt, and SvelteKit.

AI SDK UI provides robust abstractions that simplify the complex tasks of managing chat streams and UI updates on the frontend, enabling you to develop dynamic AI-driven interfaces more efficiently.

With four main hooks — [`useChat`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat), [`useCompletion`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-completion), and [`useObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-object) — you can incorporate real-time chat capabilities, text completions, streamed JSON, and interactive assistant features into your app.

Let's explore building a chatbot with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), the AI SDK, and Llama 3.1 (via [DeepInfra](https://deepinfra.com)):

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts"
import { deepinfra } from '@ai-sdk/deepinfra';
import { convertToModelMessages, streamText } from 'ai';

// Allow streaming responses up to 30 seconds
export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: deepinfra('meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct'),
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';

export default function Page() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat();

  return (
    <>
      {messages.map((message) => (
        <div key={message.id}>
          {message.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
          {message.content}
        </div>
      ))}
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input name="prompt" value={input} onChange={handleInputChange} />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    </>
  );
}
```

The useChat hook on your root page (`app/page.tsx`) will make a request to your AI provider endpoint (`app/api/chat/route.ts`) whenever the user submits a message. The messages are then streamed back in real-time and displayed in the chat UI.

This enables a seamless chat experience where the user can see the AI response as soon as it is available, without having to wait for the entire response to be received.

### Going Beyond Text

The AI SDK's React Server Components (RSC) API enables you to create rich, interactive interfaces that go beyond simple text generation. With the [`streamUI`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-rsc/stream-ui) function, you can dynamically stream React components from the server to the client.

Let's dive into how you can leverage tools with [AI SDK RSC](/docs/ai-sdk-rsc/overview) to build a generative user interface with Next.js (App Router).

First, create a Server Action.

```tsx filename="app/actions.tsx"
'use server';

import { streamUI } from '@ai-sdk/rsc';
import { deepinfra } from '@ai-sdk/deepinfra';
import { z } from 'zod';

export async function streamComponent() {
  const result = await streamUI({
    model: deepinfra('meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct'),
    prompt: 'Get the weather for San Francisco',
    text: ({ content }) => <div>{content}</div>,
    tools: {
      getWeather: {
        description: 'Get the weather for a location',
        inputSchema: z.object({ location: z.string() }),
        generate: async function* ({ location }) {
          yield <div>loading...</div>;
          const weather = '25c'; // await getWeather(location);
          return (
            <div>
              the weather in {location} is {weather}.
            </div>
          );
        },
      },
    },
  });
  return result.value;
}
```

In this example, if the model decides to use the `getWeather` tool, it will first yield a `div` while fetching the weather data, then return a weather component with the fetched data (note: static data in this example). This allows for a more dynamic and responsive UI that can adapt based on the AI's decisions and external data.

On the frontend, you can call this Server Action like any other asynchronous function in your application. In this case, the function returns a regular React component.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';
import { streamComponent } from './actions';

export default function Page() {
  const [component, setComponent] = useState<React.ReactNode>();

  return (
    <div>
      <form
        onSubmit={async (e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          setComponent(await streamComponent());
        }}
      >
        <button>Stream Component</button>
      </form>
      <div>{component}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Migrate from OpenAI

One of the key advantages of the AI SDK is its unified API, which makes it incredibly easy to switch between different AI models and providers. This flexibility is particularly useful when you want to migrate from one model to another, such as moving from OpenAI's GPT models to Meta's Llama models hosted on DeepInfra.

Here's how simple the migration process can be:

**OpenAI Example:**

```tsx
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4.1'),
  prompt: 'What is love?',
});
```

**Llama on DeepInfra Example:**

```tsx
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { deepinfra } from '@ai-sdk/deepinfra';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: deepinfra('meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct'),
  prompt: 'What is love?',
});
```

Thanks to the unified API, the core structure of the code remains the same. The main differences are:

1. Creating a DeepInfra client
2. Changing the model name from `openai("gpt-4.1")` to `deepinfra("meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct")`.

With just these few changes, you've migrated from using OpenAI's GPT-4-Turbo to Meta's Llama 3.1 hosted on DeepInfra. The `generateText` function and its usage remain identical, showcasing the power of the AI SDK's unified API.

This feature allows you to easily experiment with different models, compare their performance, and choose the best one for your specific use case without having to rewrite large portions of your codebase.

## Prompt Engineering and Fine-tuning

While the Llama 3.1 family of models are powerful out-of-the-box, their performance can be enhanced through effective prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques.

### Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting input prompts to elicit desired outputs from language models. It involves structuring and phrasing prompts in ways that guide the model towards producing more accurate, relevant, and coherent responses.

For more information on prompt engineering techniques (specific to Llama models), check out these resources:

- [Official Llama 3.1 Prompt Guide](https://llama.meta.com/docs/how-to-guides/prompting)
- [Prompt Engineering with Llama 3](https://github.com/amitsangani/Llama/blob/main/Llama_3_Prompt_Engineering.ipynb)
- [How to prompt Llama 3](https://huggingface.co/blog/llama3#how-to-prompt-llama-3)

### Fine-tuning

Fine-tuning involves further training a pre-trained model on a specific dataset or task to customize its performance for particular use cases. This process allows you to adapt Llama 3.1 to your specific domain or application, potentially improving its accuracy and relevance for your needs.

To learn more about fine-tuning Llama models, check out these resources:

# Get started with OpenAI GPT-5

With the [release of OpenAI's GPT-5 model](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5), there has never been a better time to start building AI applications with advanced capabilities like verbosity control, web search, and native multi-modal understanding.

The [AI SDK](/) is a powerful TypeScript toolkit for building AI applications with large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI GPT-5 alongside popular frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more.

## OpenAI GPT-5

OpenAI's GPT-5 represents their latest advancement in language models, offering powerful new features including verbosity control for tailored response lengths, integrated web search capabilities, reasoning summaries for transparency, and native support for text, images, audio, and PDFs. The model is available in three variants: `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini` for faster, more cost-effective processing, and `gpt-5-nano` for ultra-efficient operations.

### Prompt Engineering for GPT-5

Here are the key strategies for effective prompting:

#### Core Principles

1. **Be precise and unambiguous**: Avoid contradictory or ambiguous instructions. GPT-5 performs best with clear, explicit guidance.
2. **Use structured prompts**: Leverage XML-like tags to organize different sections of your instructions for better clarity.
3. **Natural language works best**: While being precise, write prompts as you would explain to a skilled colleague.

#### Prompting Techniques

**1. Agentic Workflow Control**

- Adjust the `reasoningEffort` parameter to calibrate model autonomy
- Set clear stop conditions and define explicit tool call budgets
- Provide guidance on exploration depth and persistence

```ts
// Example with reasoning effort control
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5'),
  prompt: 'Analyze this complex dataset and provide insights.',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      reasoningEffort: 'high', // Increases autonomous exploration
    },
  },
});
```

**2. Structured Prompt Format**
Use XML-like tags to organize your prompts:

```
<context_gathering>
Goal: Extract key performance metrics from the report
Method: Focus on quantitative data and year-over-year comparisons
Early stop criteria: Stop after finding 5 key metrics
</context_gathering>

<task>
Analyze the attached financial report and identify the most important metrics.
</task>
```

**3. Tool Calling Best Practices**

- Use tool preambles to provide clear upfront plans
- Define safe vs. unsafe actions for different tools
- Create structured updates about tool call progress

**4. Verbosity Control**

- Use the `textVerbosity` parameter to control response length programmatically
- Override with natural language when needed for specific contexts
- Balance between conciseness and completeness

**5. Optimization Workflow**

- Start with a clear, simple prompt
- Test and identify areas of ambiguity or confusion
- Iteratively refine by removing contradictions
- Consider using OpenAI's Prompt Optimizer tool for complex prompts
- Document successful patterns for reuse

## Getting Started with the AI SDK

The AI SDK is the TypeScript toolkit designed to help developers build AI-powered applications with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more. Integrating LLMs into applications is complicated and heavily dependent on the specific model provider you use.

The AI SDK abstracts away the differences between model providers, eliminates boilerplate code for building chatbots, and allows you to go beyond text output to generate rich, interactive components.

At the center of the AI SDK is [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core/overview), which provides a unified API to call any LLM. The code snippet below is all you need to call OpenAI GPT-5 with the AI SDK:

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5'),
  prompt: 'Explain the concept of quantum entanglement.',
});
```

### Generating Structured Data

While text generation can be useful, you might want to generate structured JSON data. For example, you might want to extract information from text, classify data, or generate synthetic data. AI SDK Core provides two functions ([`generateObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-object) and [`streamObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-object)) to generate structured data, allowing you to constrain model outputs to a specific schema.

```ts
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const { object } = await generateObject({
  model: openai('gpt-5'),
  schema: z.object({
    recipe: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      ingredients: z.array(z.object({ name: z.string(), amount: z.string() })),
      steps: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});
```

This code snippet will generate a type-safe recipe that conforms to the specified zod schema.

### Verbosity Control

One of GPT-5's new features is verbosity control, allowing you to adjust response length without modifying your prompt:

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

// Concise response
const { text: conciseText } = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5'),
  prompt: 'Explain quantum computing.',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      textVerbosity: 'low', // Produces terse, minimal responses
    },
  },
});

// Detailed response
const { text: detailedText } = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5'),
  prompt: 'Explain quantum computing.',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      textVerbosity: 'high', // Produces comprehensive, detailed responses
    },
  },
});
```

### Web Search

GPT-5 can access real-time information through the integrated web search tool:

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5'),
  prompt: 'What are the latest developments in AI this week?',
  tools: {
    web_search: openai.tools.webSearch({
      searchContextSize: 'high',
    }),
  },
});

// Access URL sources
const sources = result.sources;
```

### Reasoning Summaries

For transparency into GPT-5's thought process, enable reasoning summaries:

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = streamText({
  model: openai.responses('gpt-5'),
  prompt:
    'Solve this logic puzzle: If all roses are flowers and some flowers fade quickly, do all roses fade quickly?',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      reasoningSummary: 'detailed', // 'auto' for condensed or 'detailed' for comprehensive
    },
  },
});

// Stream reasoning and text separately
for await (const part of result.fullStream) {
  if (part.type === 'reasoning') {
    console.log(part.textDelta);
  } else if (part.type === 'text-delta') {
    process.stdout.write(part.textDelta);
  }
}
```

### Using Tools with the AI SDK

GPT-5 supports tool calling out of the box, allowing it to interact with external systems and perform discrete tasks. Here's an example of using tool calling with the AI SDK:

```ts
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const { toolResults } = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5'),
  prompt: 'What is the weather like today in San Francisco?',
  tools: {
    getWeather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
  },
});
```

### Building Interactive Interfaces

AI SDK Core can be paired with [AI SDK UI](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/overview), another powerful component of the AI SDK, to streamline the process of building chat, completion, and assistant interfaces with popular frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt, and SvelteKit.

AI SDK UI provides robust abstractions that simplify the complex tasks of managing chat streams and UI updates on the frontend, enabling you to develop dynamic AI-driven interfaces more efficiently.

With four main hooks — [`useChat`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat), [`useCompletion`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-completion), and [`useObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-object) — you can incorporate real-time chat capabilities, text completions, streamed JSON, and interactive assistant features into your app.

Let's explore building a chatbot with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), the AI SDK, and OpenAI GPT-5:

In a new Next.js application, first install the AI SDK and the OpenAI provider:

<Snippet text="pnpm install ai @ai-sdk/openai @ai-sdk/react" />

Then, create a route handler for the chat endpoint:

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { convertToModelMessages, streamText, UIMessage } from 'ai';

// Allow responses up to 30 seconds
export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: openai('gpt-5'),
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

Finally, update the root page (`app/page.tsx`) to use the `useChat` hook:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Page() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat({});

  return (
    <>
      {messages.map((message) => (
        <div key={message.id}>
          {message.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
          {message.parts.map((part, index) => {
            if (part.type === 'text') {
              return <span key={index}>{part.text}</span>;
            }
            return null;
          })}
        </div>
      ))}
      <form
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          if (input.trim()) {
            sendMessage({ text: input });
            setInput('');
          }
        }}
      >
        <input
          name="prompt"
          value={input}
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    </>
  );
}
```

The useChat hook on your root page (`app/page.tsx`) will make a request to your AI provider endpoint (`app/api/chat/route.ts`) whenever the user submits a message. The messages are then displayed in the chat UI.

# Get started with OpenAI o1

With the [release of OpenAI's o1 series models](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/), there has never been a better time to start building AI applications, particularly those that require complex reasoning capabilities.

The [AI SDK](/) is a powerful TypeScript toolkit for building AI applications with large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI o1 alongside popular frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more.

## OpenAI o1

OpenAI released a series of AI models designed to spend more time thinking before responding. They can reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science, coding, and math. These models, named the o1 series, are trained with reinforcement learning and can "think before they answer". As a result, they are able to produce a long internal chain of thought before responding to a prompt.

The main reasoning model available in the API is:

1. [**o1**](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#o1): Designed to reason about hard problems using broad general knowledge about the world.

| Model | Streaming           | Tools               | Object Generation   | Reasoning Effort    |
| ----- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| o1    | <Cross size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> |

### Benchmarks

OpenAI o1 models excel in scientific reasoning, with impressive performance across various domains:

- Ranking in the 89th percentile on competitive programming questions (Codeforces)
- Placing among the top 500 students in the US in a qualifier for the USA Math Olympiad (AIME)
- Exceeding human PhD-level accuracy on a benchmark of physics, biology, and chemistry problems (GPQA)

[Source](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/)

### Prompt Engineering for o1 Models

The o1 models perform best with straightforward prompts. Some prompt engineering techniques, like few-shot prompting or instructing the model to "think step by step," may not enhance performance and can sometimes hinder it. Here are some best practices:

1. Keep prompts simple and direct: The models excel at understanding and responding to brief, clear instructions without the need for extensive guidance.
2. Avoid chain-of-thought prompts: Since these models perform reasoning internally, prompting them to "think step by step" or "explain your reasoning" is unnecessary.
3. Use delimiters for clarity: Use delimiters like triple quotation marks, XML tags, or section titles to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input, helping the model interpret different sections appropriately.
4. Limit additional context in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG): When providing additional context or documents, include only the most relevant information to prevent the model from overcomplicating its response.

## Getting Started with the AI SDK

The AI SDK is the TypeScript toolkit designed to help developers build AI-powered applications with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more. Integrating LLMs into applications is complicated and heavily dependent on the specific model provider you use.

The AI SDK abstracts away the differences between model providers, eliminates boilerplate code for building chatbots, and allows you to go beyond text output to generate rich, interactive components.

At the center of the AI SDK is [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core/overview), which provides a unified API to call any LLM. The code snippet below is all you need to call OpenAI o1 with the AI SDK:

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai('o1'),
  prompt: 'Explain the concept of quantum entanglement.',
});
```

<Note>
  To use the o1 model, you must either be using @ai-sdk/openai version 0.0.59 or
  greater, or set `temperature: 1`.
</Note>

AI SDK Core abstracts away the differences between model providers, allowing you to focus on building great applications. The unified interface also means that you can easily switch between models by changing just one line of code.

```ts highlight="5"
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai('o1'),
  prompt: 'Explain the concept of quantum entanglement.',
});
```

<Note>
  System messages are automatically converted to OpenAI developer messages.
</Note>

### Refining Reasoning Effort

You can control the amount of reasoning effort expended by o1 through the `reasoningEffort` parameter.
This parameter can be set to `'low'`, `'medium'`, or `'high'` to adjust how much time and computation the model spends on internal reasoning before producing a response.

```ts highlight="9"
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

// Reduce reasoning effort for faster responses
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai('o1'),
  prompt: 'Explain quantum entanglement briefly.',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: { reasoningEffort: 'low' },
  },
});
```

<Note>
  The `reasoningEffort` parameter is only supported by o1 and has no effect on
  other models.
</Note>

### Generating Structured Data

While text generation can be useful, you might want to generate structured JSON data. For example, you might want to extract information from text, classify data, or generate synthetic data. AI SDK Core provides two functions ([`generateObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-object) and [`streamObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-object)) to generate structured data, allowing you to constrain model outputs to a specific schema.

```ts
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const { object } = await generateObject({
  model: openai('o1'),
  schema: z.object({
    recipe: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      ingredients: z.array(z.object({ name: z.string(), amount: z.string() })),
      steps: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});
```

This code snippet will generate a type-safe recipe that conforms to the specified zod schema.

<Note>Structured object generation is supported with o1.</Note>

### Tools

While LLMs have incredible generation capabilities, they struggle with discrete tasks (e.g. mathematics) and interacting with the outside world (e.g. getting the weather). The solution: [tools](/docs/foundations/tools), which are like programs that you provide to the model, which it can choose to call as necessary.

### Using Tools with the AI SDK

The AI SDK supports tool usage across several of its functions, like [`generateText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-text) and [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text). By passing one or more tools to the `tools` parameter, you can extend the capabilities of LLMs, allowing them to perform discrete tasks and interact with external systems.

Here's an example of how you can use a tool with the AI SDK and o1:

```ts
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai('o1'),
  prompt: 'What is the weather like today?',
  tools: {
    getWeather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
  },
});
```

In this example, the `getWeather` tool allows the model to fetch real-time weather data (simulated for simplicity), enhancing its ability to provide accurate and up-to-date information.

<Note>Tools are compatible with o1.</Note>

### Building Interactive Interfaces

AI SDK Core can be paired with [AI SDK UI](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/overview), another powerful component of the AI SDK, to streamline the process of building chat, completion, and assistant interfaces with popular frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt, and SvelteKit.

AI SDK UI provides robust abstractions that simplify the complex tasks of managing chat streams and UI updates on the frontend, enabling you to develop dynamic AI-driven interfaces more efficiently.

With four main hooks — [`useChat`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat), [`useCompletion`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-completion), and [`useObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-object) — you can incorporate real-time chat capabilities, text completions, streamed JSON, and interactive assistant features into your app.

Let's explore building a chatbot with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), the AI SDK, and OpenAI o1:

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { convertToModelMessages, streamText, UIMessage } from 'ai';

// Allow responses up to 5 minutes
export const maxDuration = 300;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: openai('o1'),
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';

export default function Page() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit, error } = useChat();

  return (
    <>
      {messages.map((message) => (
        <div key={message.id}>
          {message.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
          {message.content}
        </div>
      ))}
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input name="prompt" value={input} onChange={handleInputChange} />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    </>
  );
}
```

The useChat hook on your root page (`app/page.tsx`) will make a request to your AI provider endpoint (`app/api/chat/route.ts`) whenever the user submits a message. The messages are then displayed in the chat UI.

# Get started with OpenAI o3-mini

With the [release of OpenAI's o3-mini model](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/), there has never been a better time to start building AI applications, particularly those that require complex STEM reasoning capabilities.

The [AI SDK](/) is a powerful TypeScript toolkit for building AI applications with large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI o3-mini alongside popular frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more.

## OpenAI o3-mini

OpenAI recently released a new AI model optimized for STEM reasoning that excels in science, math, and coding tasks. o3-mini matches o1's performance in these domains while delivering faster responses and lower costs. The model supports tool calling, structured outputs, and system messages, making it a great option for a wide range of applications.

o3-mini offers three reasoning effort levels:

1. [**Low**]: Optimized for speed while maintaining solid reasoning capabilities
2. [**Medium**]: Balanced approach matching o1's performance levels
3. [**High**]: Enhanced reasoning power exceeding o1 in many STEM domains

| Model   | Streaming           | Tool Calling        | Structured Output   | Reasoning Effort    | Image Input         |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| o3-mini | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Cross size={18} /> |

### Benchmarks

OpenAI o3-mini demonstrates impressive performance across technical domains:

- 87.3% accuracy on AIME competition math questions
- 79.7% accuracy on PhD-level science questions (GPQA Diamond)
- 2130 Elo rating on competitive programming (Codeforces)
- 49.3% accuracy on verified software engineering tasks (SWE-bench)

<Note>These benchmark results are using high reasoning effort setting.</Note>

### Prompt Engineering for o3-mini

The o3-mini model performs best with straightforward prompts. Some prompt engineering techniques, like few-shot prompting or instructing the model to "think step by step," may not enhance performance and can sometimes hinder it. Here are some best practices:

1. Keep prompts simple and direct: The model excels at understanding and responding to brief, clear instructions without the need for extensive guidance.
2. Avoid chain-of-thought prompts: Since the model performs reasoning internally, prompting it to "think step by step" or "explain your reasoning" is unnecessary.
3. Use delimiters for clarity: Use delimiters like triple quotation marks, XML tags, or section titles to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input.

## Getting Started with the AI SDK

The AI SDK is the TypeScript toolkit designed to help developers build AI-powered applications with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more. Integrating LLMs into applications is complicated and heavily dependent on the specific model provider you use.

The AI SDK abstracts away the differences between model providers, eliminates boilerplate code for building chatbots, and allows you to go beyond text output to generate rich, interactive components.

At the center of the AI SDK is [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core/overview), which provides a unified API to call any LLM. The code snippet below is all you need to call OpenAI o3-mini with the AI SDK:

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai('o3-mini'),
  prompt: 'Explain the concept of quantum entanglement.',
});
```

<Note>
  To use o3-mini, you must be using @ai-sdk/openai version 1.1.9 or greater.
</Note>

<Note>
  System messages are automatically converted to OpenAI developer messages.
</Note>

### Refining Reasoning Effort

You can control the amount of reasoning effort expended by o3-mini through the `reasoningEffort` parameter.
This parameter can be set to `low`, `medium`, or `high` to adjust how much time and computation the model spends on internal reasoning before producing a response.

```ts highlight="9"
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

// Reduce reasoning effort for faster responses
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai('o3-mini'),
  prompt: 'Explain quantum entanglement briefly.',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: { reasoningEffort: 'low' },
  },
});
```

### Generating Structured Data

While text generation can be useful, you might want to generate structured JSON data. For example, you might want to extract information from text, classify data, or generate synthetic data. AI SDK Core provides two functions ([`generateObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-object) and [`streamObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-object)) to generate structured data, allowing you to constrain model outputs to a specific schema.

```ts
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const { object } = await generateObject({
  model: openai('o3-mini'),
  schema: z.object({
    recipe: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      ingredients: z.array(z.object({ name: z.string(), amount: z.string() })),
      steps: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});
```

This code snippet will generate a type-safe recipe that conforms to the specified zod schema.

### Using Tools with the AI SDK

o3-mini supports tool calling out of the box, allowing it to interact with external systems and perform discrete tasks. Here's an example of using tool calling with the AI SDK:

```ts
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai('o3-mini'),
  prompt: 'What is the weather like today in San Francisco?',
  tools: {
    getWeather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
  },
});
```

In this example, the `getWeather` tool allows the model to fetch real-time weather data (simulated for simplicity), enhancing its ability to provide accurate and up-to-date information.

### Building Interactive Interfaces

AI SDK Core can be paired with [AI SDK UI](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/overview), another powerful component of the AI SDK, to streamline the process of building chat, completion, and assistant interfaces with popular frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt, and SvelteKit.

AI SDK UI provides robust abstractions that simplify the complex tasks of managing chat streams and UI updates on the frontend, enabling you to develop dynamic AI-driven interfaces more efficiently.

With four main hooks — [`useChat`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat), [`useCompletion`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-completion), and [`useObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-object) — you can incorporate real-time chat capabilities, text completions, streamed JSON, and interactive assistant features into your app.

Let's explore building a chatbot with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), the AI SDK, and OpenAI o3-mini:

In a new Next.js application, first install the AI SDK and the DeepSeek provider:

<Snippet text="pnpm install ai @ai-sdk/openai @ai-sdk/react" />

Then, create a route handler for the chat endpoint:

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { convertToModelMessages, streamText, UIMessage } from 'ai';

// Allow responses up to 5 minutes
export const maxDuration = 300;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: openai('o3-mini'),
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

Finally, update the root page (`app/page.tsx`) to use the `useChat` hook:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';

export default function Page() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit, error } = useChat();

  return (
    <>
      {messages.map((message) => (
        <div key={message.id}>
          {message.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
          {message.content}
        </div>
      ))}
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input name="prompt" value={input} onChange={handleInputChange} />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    </>
  );
}
```

The useChat hook on your root page (`app/page.tsx`) will make a request to your AI provider endpoint (`app/api/chat/route.ts`) whenever the user submits a message. The messages are then displayed in the chat UI.

# Get started with DeepSeek R1

With the [release of DeepSeek R1](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news250528), there has never been a better time to start building AI applications, particularly those that require complex reasoning capabilities.

The [AI SDK](/) is a powerful TypeScript toolkit for building AI applications with large language models (LLMs) like DeepSeek R1 alongside popular frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more.

## DeepSeek R1

DeepSeek R1 is a series of advanced AI models designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks in science, coding, and mathematics. These models are optimized to "think before they answer," producing detailed internal chains of thought that aid in solving challenging problems.

The series includes two primary variants:

- **DeepSeek R1-Zero**: Trained exclusively with reinforcement learning (RL) without any supervised fine-tuning. It exhibits advanced reasoning capabilities but may struggle with readability and formatting.
- **DeepSeek R1**: Combines reinforcement learning with cold-start data and supervised fine-tuning to improve both reasoning performance and the readability of outputs.

### Benchmarks

DeepSeek R1 models excel in reasoning tasks, delivering competitive performance across key benchmarks:

- **AIME 2024 (Pass\@1)**: 79.8%
- **MATH-500 (Pass\@1)**: 97.3%
- **Codeforces (Percentile)**: Top 4% (96.3%)
- **GPQA Diamond (Pass\@1)**: 71.5%

[Source](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1?tab=readme-ov-file#4-evaluation-results)

### Prompt Engineering for DeepSeek R1 Models

DeepSeek R1 models excel with structured and straightforward prompts. The following best practices can help achieve optimal performance:

1. **Use a structured format**: Leverage the model’s preferred output structure with `<think>` tags for reasoning and `<answer>` tags for the final result.
2. **Prefer zero-shot prompts**: Avoid few-shot prompting as it can degrade performance; instead, directly state the problem clearly.
3. **Specify output expectations**: Guide the model by defining desired formats, such as markdown for readability or XML-like tags for clarity.

## Getting Started with the AI SDK

The AI SDK is the TypeScript toolkit designed to help developers build AI-powered applications with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more. Integrating LLMs into applications is complicated and heavily dependent on the specific model provider you use.

The AI SDK abstracts away the differences between model providers, eliminates boilerplate code for building chatbots, and allows you to go beyond text output to generate rich, interactive components.

At the center of the AI SDK is [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core/overview), which provides a unified API to call any LLM. The code snippet below is all you need to call DeepSeek R1 with the AI SDK:

```ts
import { deepseek } from '@ai-sdk/deepseek';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { reasoningText, text } = await generateText({
  model: deepseek('deepseek-reasoner'),
  prompt: 'Explain quantum entanglement.',
});
```

The unified interface also means that you can easily switch between providers by changing just two lines of code. For example, to use DeepSeek R1 via Fireworks:

```ts
import { fireworks } from '@ai-sdk/fireworks';
import {
  generateText,
  wrapLanguageModel,
  extractReasoningMiddleware,
} from 'ai';

// middleware to extract reasoning tokens
const enhancedModel = wrapLanguageModel({
  model: fireworks('accounts/fireworks/models/deepseek-r1'),
  middleware: extractReasoningMiddleware({ tagName: 'think' }),
});

const { reasoningText, text } = await generateText({
  model: enhancedModel,
  prompt: 'Explain quantum entanglement.',
});
```

Or to use Groq's `deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b` model:

```ts
import { groq } from '@ai-sdk/groq';
import {
  generateText,
  wrapLanguageModel,
  extractReasoningMiddleware,
} from 'ai';

// middleware to extract reasoning tokens
const enhancedModel = wrapLanguageModel({
  model: groq('deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b'),
  middleware: extractReasoningMiddleware({ tagName: 'think' }),
});

const { reasoningText, text } = await generateText({
  model: enhancedModel,
  prompt: 'Explain quantum entanglement.',
});
```

<Note id="deepseek-r1-middleware">
The AI SDK provides a [middleware](/docs/ai-sdk-core/middleware)
(`extractReasoningMiddleware`) that can be used to extract the reasoning
tokens from the model's output.

When using DeepSeek-R1 series models with third-party providers like Together AI, we recommend using the `startWithReasoning`
option in the `extractReasoningMiddleware` function, as they tend to bypass thinking patterns.

</Note>

### Model Provider Comparison

You can use DeepSeek R1 with the AI SDK through various providers. Here's a comparison of the providers that support DeepSeek R1:

| Provider                                                | Model ID                                                                                                          | Reasoning Tokens    |

### Building Interactive Interfaces

AI SDK Core can be paired with [AI SDK UI](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/overview), another powerful component of the AI SDK, to streamline the process of building chat, completion, and assistant interfaces with popular frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt, and SvelteKit.

AI SDK UI provides robust abstractions that simplify the complex tasks of managing chat streams and UI updates on the frontend, enabling you to develop dynamic AI-driven interfaces more efficiently.

With four main hooks — [`useChat`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat), [`useCompletion`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-completion), and [`useObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-object) — you can incorporate real-time chat capabilities, text completions, streamed JSON, and interactive assistant features into your app.

Let's explore building a chatbot with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), the AI SDK, and DeepSeek R1:

In a new Next.js application, first install the AI SDK and the DeepSeek provider:

<Snippet text="pnpm install ai @ai-sdk/deepseek @ai-sdk/react" />

Then, create a route handler for the chat endpoint:

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts"
import { deepseek } from '@ai-sdk/deepseek';
import { convertToModelMessages, streamText, UIMessage } from 'ai';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: deepseek('deepseek-reasoner'),
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse({
    sendReasoning: true,
  });
}
```

<Note>
  You can forward the model's reasoning tokens to the client with
  `sendReasoning: true` in the `toDataStreamResponse` method.
</Note>

Finally, update the root page (`app/page.tsx`) to use the `useChat` hook:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Page() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat();

  const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (input.trim()) {
      sendMessage({ text: input });
      setInput('');
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      {messages.map((message) => (
        <div key={message.id}>
          {message.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
          {message.parts.map((part, index) => {
            if (part.type === 'reasoning') {
              return <pre key={index}>{part.text}</pre>;
            }
            if (part.type === 'text') {
              return <span key={index}>{part.text}</span>;
            }
            return null;
          })}
        </div>
      ))}
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          name="prompt"
          value={input}
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    </>
  );
}
```

<Note>
  You can access the model's reasoning tokens through the `parts` array on the
  `message` object, where reasoning parts have `type: 'reasoning'`.
</Note>

The useChat hook on your root page (`app/page.tsx`) will make a request to your AI provider endpoint (`app/api/chat/route.ts`) whenever the user submits a message. The messages are then displayed in the chat UI.

## Limitations

While DeepSeek R1 models are powerful, they have certain limitations:

- No tool-calling support: DeepSeek R1 cannot directly interact with APIs or external tools.
- No object generation support: DeepSeek R1 does not support structured object generation. However, you can combine it with models that support structured object generation (like gpt-4o-mini) to generate objects. See the [structured object generation with a reasoning model recipe](/cookbook/node/generate-object-reasoning) for more information.

# Node.js HTTP Server

You can use the AI SDK in a Node.js HTTP server to generate text and stream it to the client.

## Examples

The examples start a simple HTTP server that listens on port 8080. You can e.g. test it using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080
```

<Note>
  The examples use the Vercel AI Gateway. Ensure that your AI Gateway API key is
  set in the `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` environment variable.
</Note>

**Full example**: [github.com/vercel/ai/examples/node-http-server](https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/examples/node-http-server)

### UI Message Stream

You can use the `pipeUIMessageStreamToResponse` method to pipe the stream data to the server response.

```ts filename='index.ts'
import { streamText } from 'ai';
import { createServer } from 'http';

createServer(async (req, res) => {
  const result = streamText({
    model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
    prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
  });

  result.pipeUIMessageStreamToResponse(res);
}).listen(8080);
```

### Sending Custom Data

`createUIMessageStream` and `pipeUIMessageStreamToResponse` can be used to send custom data to the client.

```ts filename='index.ts'
import {
  createUIMessageStream,
  pipeUIMessageStreamToResponse,
  streamText,
} from 'ai';
import { createServer } from 'http';

createServer(async (req, res) => {
  switch (req.url) {
    case '/stream-data': {
      const stream = createUIMessageStream({
        execute: ({ writer }) => {
          // write some custom data
          writer.write({ type: 'start' });

          writer.write({
            type: 'data-custom',
            data: {
              custom: 'Hello, world!',
            },
          });

          const result = streamText({
            model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
            prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
          });

          writer.merge(
            result.toUIMessageStream({
              sendStart: false,
              onError: (error) => {
                // Error messages are masked by default for security reasons.
                // If you want to expose the error message to the client, you can do so here:
                return error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error);
              },
            })
          );
        },
      });

      pipeUIMessageStreamToResponse({ stream, response: res });

      break;
    }
  }
}).listen(8080);
```

### Text Stream

You can send a text stream to the client using `pipeTextStreamToResponse`.

```ts filename='index.ts'
import { streamText } from 'ai';
import { createServer } from 'http';

createServer(async (req, res) => {
  const result = streamText({
    model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
    prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
  });

  result.pipeTextStreamToResponse(res);
}).listen(8080);
```

# Express

You can use the AI SDK in an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server to generate and stream text and objects to the client.

## Examples

The examples start a simple HTTP server that listens on port 8080. You can e.g. test it using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080
```

<Note>
  The examples use the Vercel AI Gateway. Ensure that your AI Gateway API key is
  set in the `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` environment variable.
</Note>

**Full example**: [github.com/vercel/ai/examples/express](https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/examples/express)

### UI Message Stream

You can use the `pipeUIMessageStreamToResponse` method to pipe the stream data to the server response.

```ts filename='index.ts'
import { streamText } from 'ai';
import express, { Request, Response } from 'express';

const app = express();

app.post('/', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const result = streamText({
    model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
    prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
  });

  result.pipeUIMessageStreamToResponse(res);
});

app.listen(8080, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${8080}`);
});
```

### Sending Custom Data

`pipeUIMessageStreamToResponse` can be used to send custom data to the client.

```ts filename='index.ts'
import {
  createUIMessageStream,
  pipeUIMessageStreamToResponse,
  streamText,
} from 'ai';
import express, { Request, Response } from 'express';

const app = express();

app.post('/custom-data-parts', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  pipeUIMessageStreamToResponse({
    response: res,
    stream: createUIMessageStream({
      execute: async ({ writer }) => {
        writer.write({ type: 'start' });

        writer.write({
          type: 'data-custom',
          data: {
            custom: 'Hello, world!',
          },
        });

        const result = streamText({
          model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
          prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
        });

        writer.merge(result.toUIMessageStream({ sendStart: false }));
      },
    }),
  });
});

app.listen(8080, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${8080}`);
});
```

### Text Stream

You can send a text stream to the client using `pipeTextStreamToResponse`.

```ts filename='index.ts'

```ts filename='index.ts'
import { serve } from '@hono/node-server';
import { streamText } from 'ai';
import { Hono } from 'hono';

const app = new Hono();

app.post('/text', async (c) => {
  const result = streamText({
    model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
    prompt: 'Write a short poem about coding.',
  });
  return result.toTextStreamResponse();
});

serve({ fetch: app.fetch, port: 8080 });
```

### Sending Custom Data

You can use `createUIMessageStream` and `createUIMessageStreamResponse` to send custom data to the client.

```ts filename='index.ts'
import { serve } from '@hono/node-server';
import {
  createUIMessageStream,
  createUIMessageStreamResponse,
  streamText,
} from 'ai';
import { Hono } from 'hono';

const app = new Hono();

app.post('/stream-data', async (c) => {
  // immediately start streaming the response
  const stream = createUIMessageStream({
    execute: ({ writer }) => {
      writer.write({ type: 'start' });

      writer.write({
        type: 'data-custom',
        data: {

</Note>

**Full example**: [github.com/vercel/ai/examples/fastify](https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/examples/fastify)

### Data Stream

You can use the `toDataStream` method to get a data stream from the result and then pipe it to the response.

```ts filename='index.ts'
import { streamText } from 'ai';
import Fastify from 'fastify';

const fastify = Fastify({ logger: true });

fastify.post('/', async function (request, reply) {
  const result = streamText({
    model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
    prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
  });

  // Mark the response as a v1 data stream:
  reply.header('X-Vercel-AI-Data-Stream', 'v1');
  reply.header('Content-Type', 'text/plain; charset=utf-8');

  return reply.send(result.toDataStream({ data }));
});

fastify.listen({ port: 8080 });
```

### Sending Custom Data

`createDataStream` can be used to send custom data to the client.

```ts filename='index.ts' highlight="8-11,18"
import { createDataStream, streamText } from 'ai';
import Fastify from 'fastify';

const fastify = Fastify({ logger: true });

fastify.post('/stream-data', async function (request, reply) {
  // immediately start streaming the response
  const dataStream = createDataStream({
    execute: async (dataStreamWriter) => {
      dataStreamWriter.writeData('initialized call');

      const result = streamText({
        model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
        prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
      });

      result.mergeIntoDataStream(dataStreamWriter);
    },
    onError: (error) => {
      // Error messages are masked by default for security reasons.
      // If you want to expose the error message to the client, you can do so here:
      return error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error);
    },
  });

  // Mark the response as a v1 data stream:
  reply.header('X-Vercel-AI-Data-Stream', 'v1');
  reply.header('Content-Type', 'text/plain; charset=utf-8');

  return reply.send(dataStream);
});

fastify.listen({ port: 8080 });
```

### Text Stream

You can use the `textStream` property to get a text stream from the result and then pipe it to the response.

```ts filename='index.ts' highlight="15"
import { streamText } from 'ai';
import Fastify from 'fastify';

const fastify = Fastify({ logger: true });

fastify.post('/', async function (request, reply) {
  const result = streamText({
    model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
    prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
  });

  reply.header('Content-Type', 'text/plain; charset=utf-8');

  return reply.send(result.textStream);
});

fastify.listen({ port: 8080 });

description: The AI SDK is the TypeScript toolkit for building AI applications and agents with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more.

---

# AI SDK

The AI SDK is the TypeScript toolkit designed to help developers build AI-powered applications and agents with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more.

## Why use the AI SDK?

Integrating large language models (LLMs) into applications is complicated and heavily dependent on the specific model provider you use.

The AI SDK standardizes integrating artificial intelligence (AI) models across [supported providers](/docs/foundations/providers-and-models). This enables developers to focus on building great AI applications, not waste time on technical details.

For example, here’s how you can generate text with various models using the AI SDK:

<PreviewSwitchProviders />

The AI SDK has two main libraries:

- **[AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core):** A unified API for generating text, structured objects, tool calls, and building agents with LLMs.
- **[AI SDK UI](/docs/ai-sdk-ui):** A set of framework-agnostic hooks for quickly building chat and generative user interface.

## Model Providers

The AI SDK supports [multiple model providers](/providers).

<OfficialModelCards />

## Templates

We've built some [templates](https://vercel.com/templates?type=ai) that include AI SDK integrations for different use cases, providers, and frameworks. You can use these templates to get started with your AI-powered application.

### Starter Kits

<Templates type="starter-kits" />

### Feature Exploration

<Templates type="feature-exploration" />

### Frameworks

<Templates type="frameworks" />

### Generative UI

<Templates type="generative-ui" />

### Security

<Templates type="security" />

## Join our Community

If you have questions about anything related to the AI SDK, you're always welcome to ask our community on [the Vercel Community](https://community.vercel.com/c/ai-sdk/62).

## `llms.txt` (for Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Claude etc.)

You can access the entire AI SDK documentation in Markdown format at [ai-sdk.dev/llms.txt](/llms.txt). This can be used to ask any LLM (assuming it has a big enough context window) questions about the AI SDK based on the most up-to-date documentation.

### Example Usage

For instance, to prompt an LLM with questions about the AI SDK:

1. Copy the documentation contents from [ai-sdk.dev/llms.txt](/llms.txt)
2. Use the following prompt format:

```prompt
Documentation:
{paste documentation here}

title: AI SDK 6 Beta
description: Get started with the Beta version of AI SDK 6.

# Announcing AI SDK 6 Beta

<Note type="warning">
  AI SDK 6 is in beta — while more stable than alpha, AI SDK 6 is still in
  active development and APIs may still change. Pin to specific versions as
  breaking changes may occur in patch releases.
</Note>

## Why AI SDK 6?

AI SDK 6 is a **major version** due to the introduction of the **v3 Language Model Specification** that powers new capabilities like agents and tool approval. However, unlike AI SDK 5, **this release is not expected to have major breaking changes** for most users.

The version bump reflects improvements to the specification, not a complete redesign of the SDK. If you're using AI SDK 5, migrating to v6 should be straightforward with minimal code changes.

## Beta Version Guidance

The AI SDK 6 Beta is intended for:

- **Trying out new features** and giving us feedback on the developer experience
- **Experimenting with agents** and tool approval workflows

Your feedback during this beta phase directly shapes the final stable release. Share your experiences through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/vercel/ai/issues/new/choose).

## Installation

To install the AI SDK 6 Beta, run the following command:

```bash
npm install ai@beta @ai-sdk/openai@beta @ai-sdk/react@beta
```

<Note type="warning">
  APIs may still change during beta. Pin to specific versions as breaking
  changes may occur in patch releases.
</Note>

## What's New in AI SDK 6?

AI SDK 6 introduces several features (with more to come soon!):

### Agent Abstraction

A new unified interface for building agents with full control over execution flow, tool loops, and state management.

### Tool Execution Approval

Request user confirmation before executing tools, enabling native human-in-the-loop patterns.

### Structured Output (Stable)

Generate structured data alongside tool calling with `generateText` and `streamText` - now stable and production-ready.

### Reranking Support

Improve search relevance by reordering documents based on their relationship to a query using specialized reranking models.

### Image Editing Support

Native support for image editing (coming soon).

## Agent Abstraction

AI SDK 6 introduces a powerful new `Agent` interface that provides a standardized way to build agents.

### Default Implementation: ToolLoopAgent

The `ToolLoopAgent` class provides a default implementation out of the box:

```typescript
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';
import { weatherTool } from '@/tool/weather';

export const weatherAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  instructions: 'You are a helpful weather assistant.',
  tools: {
    weather: weatherTool,
  },
});

// Use the agent
const result = await weatherAgent.generate({
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco?',
});
```

The agent automatically handles the tool execution loop:

1. Calls the LLM with your prompt
2. Executes any requested tool calls
3. Adds results back to the conversation
4. Repeats until complete (default `stopWhen: stepCountIs(20)`)

### Configuring Call Options

Call options let you pass type-safe runtime inputs to dynamically configure your agents. Use them to inject retrieved documents for RAG, select models based on request complexity, customize tool behavior per request, or adjust any agent setting based on context.

Without call options, you'd need to create multiple agents or handle configuration logic outside the agent. With call options, you define a schema once and modify agent behavior at runtime:

```typescript
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const supportAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  callOptionsSchema: z.object({
    userId: z.string(),
    accountType: z.enum(['free', 'pro', 'enterprise']),
  }),
  instructions: 'You are a helpful customer support agent.',
  prepareCall: ({ options, ...settings }) => ({
    ...settings,
    instructions:
      settings.instructions +
      `\nUser context:
- Account type: ${options.accountType}
- User ID: ${options.userId}

Adjust your response based on the user's account level.`,
  }),
});

// Pass options when calling the agent
const result = await supportAgent.generate({
  prompt: 'How do I upgrade my account?',
  options: {
    userId: 'user_123',
    accountType: 'free',
  },
});
```

The `options` parameter is type-safe and will error if you don't provide it or pass incorrect types.

Call options enable dynamic agent configuration for several scenarios:

- **RAG**: Fetch relevant documents and inject them into prompts at runtime
- **Dynamic model selection**: Choose faster or more capable models based on request complexity
- **Tool configuration**: Adjust tools per request
- **Provider options**: Set reasoning effort, temperature, or other provider-specific settings dynamically

Learn more in the [Configuring Call Options](/docs/agents/configuring-call-options) documentation.

### UI Integration

Agents integrate seamlessly with React and other UI frameworks:

```typescript
// Server-side API route
import { createAgentUIStreamResponse } from 'ai';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { messages } = await request.json();

  return createAgentUIStreamResponse({
    agent: weatherAgent,
    messages,
  });
}
```

```typescript
// Client-side with type safety
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { InferAgentUIMessage } from 'ai';
import { weatherAgent } from '@/agent/weather-agent';

type WeatherAgentUIMessage = InferAgentUIMessage<typeof weatherAgent>;

const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat<WeatherAgentUIMessage>();
```

### Custom Agent Implementations

In AI SDK 6, `Agent` is an interface rather than a concrete class. While `ToolLoopAgent` provides a solid default implementation for most use cases, you can implement the `Agent` interface to build custom agent architectures:

```typescript
import { Agent } from 'ai';

// Build your own multi-agent orchestrator that delegates to specialists
class Orchestrator implements Agent {
  constructor(private subAgents: Record<string, Agent>) {
    /* Implementation */
  }
}

const orchestrator = new Orchestrator({
  subAgents: {
    // your subagents
  },
});
```

This approach enables you to experiment with orchestrators, memory layers, custom stop conditions, and agent patterns tailored to your specific use case.

## Tool Execution Approval

AI SDK 6 introduces a tool approval system that gives you control over when tools are executed.

Enable approval for a tool by setting `needsApproval`:

```typescript
import { tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

export const weatherTool = tool({
  description: 'Get the weather in a location',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string(),
  }),
  needsApproval: true, // Require user approval
  execute: async ({ city }) => {
    const weather = await fetchWeather(city);
    return weather;
  },
});
```

### Dynamic Approval

Make approval decisions based on tool input:

```typescript
export const paymentTool = tool({
  description: 'Process a payment',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    amount: z.number(),
    recipient: z.string(),
  }),
  // Only require approval for large transactions
  needsApproval: async ({ amount }) => amount > 1000,
  execute: async ({ amount, recipient }) => {
    return await processPayment(amount, recipient);
  },
});
```

### Client-Side Approval UI

Handle approval requests in your UI:

```tsx
export function WeatherToolView({ invocation, addToolApprovalResponse }) {
  if (invocation.state === 'approval-requested') {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Can I retrieve the weather for {invocation.input.city}?</p>
        <button
          onClick={() =>
            addToolApprovalResponse({
              id: invocation.approval.id,
              approved: true,
            })
          }
        >
          Approve
        </button>
        <button
          onClick={() =>
            addToolApprovalResponse({
              id: invocation.approval.id,
              approved: false,
            })
          }
        >
          Deny
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }

  if (invocation.state === 'output-available') {
    return (
      <div>
        Weather: {invocation.output.weather}
        Temperature: {invocation.output.temperature}°F
      </div>
    );
  }

  // Handle other states...
}
```

### Auto-Submit After Approvals

Automatically continue the conversation once approvals are handled:

```typescript
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { lastAssistantMessageIsCompleteWithApprovalResponses } from 'ai';

const { messages, addToolApprovalResponse } = useChat({
  sendAutomaticallyWhen: lastAssistantMessageIsCompleteWithApprovalResponses,
});
```

## Structured Output (Stable)

AI SDK 6 stabilizes structured output support for agents, enabling you to generate structured data alongside multi-step tool calling.

Previously, you could only generate structured outputs with `generateObject` and `streamObject`, which didn't support tool calling. Now `ToolLoopAgent` (and `generateText` / `streamText`) can combine both capabilities using the `output` parameter:

```typescript
import { Output, ToolLoopAgent, tool } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        city: z.string(),
      }),
      execute: async ({ city }) => {
        return { temperature: 72, condition: 'sunny' };
      },
    }),
  },
  output: Output.object({
    schema: z.object({
      summary: z.string(),
      temperature: z.number(),
      recommendation: z.string(),
    }),
  }),
});

const { output } = await agent.generate({
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco and what should I wear?',
});
// The agent calls the weather tool AND returns structured output
console.log(output);
// {
//   summary: "It's sunny in San Francisco",
//   temperature: 72,
//   recommendation: "Wear light clothing and sunglasses"
// }
```

### Output Types

The `Output` object provides multiple strategies for structured generation:

- **`Output.object()`**: Generate structured objects with Zod schemas
- **`Output.array()`**: Generate arrays of structured objects
- **`Output.choice()`**: Select from a specific set of options
- **`Output.text()`**: Generate plain text (default behavior)

### Streaming Structured Output

Use `agent.stream()` to stream structured output as it's being generated:

```typescript
import { ToolLoopAgent, Output } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const profileAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  instructions: 'Generate realistic person profiles.',
  output: Output.object({
    schema: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      age: z.number(),
      occupation: z.string(),
    }),
  }),
});

const { partialOutputStream } = await profileAgent.stream({
  prompt: 'Generate a person profile.',
});

for await (const partial of partialOutputStream) {
  console.log(partial);
  // { name: "John" }
  // { name: "John", age: 30 }
  // { name: "John", age: 30, occupation: "Engineer" }
}
```

### Support in `generateText` and `streamText`

Structured outputs are also supported in `generateText` and `streamText` functions, allowing you to use this feature outside of agents when needed.

<Note>
  When using structured output with `generateText` or `streamText`, you must
  configure multiple steps with `stopWhen` because generating the structured
  output is itself a step. For example: `stopWhen: stepCountIs(2)` to allow tool
  calling and output generation.
</Note>

## Reranking Support

AI SDK 6 introduces native support for reranking, a technique that improves search relevance by reordering documents based on their relationship to a query.

Unlike embedding-based similarity search, reranking models are specifically trained to understand query-document relationships, producing more accurate relevance scores:

```typescript
import { rerank } from 'ai';
import { cohere } from '@ai-sdk/cohere';

const documents = [
  'sunny day at the beach',
  'rainy afternoon in the city',
  'snowy night in the mountains',
];

const { ranking } = await rerank({
  model: cohere.reranking('rerank-v3.5'),
  documents,
  query: 'talk about rain',
  topN: 2,
});

console.log(ranking);
// [
//   { originalIndex: 1, score: 0.9, document: 'rainy afternoon in the city' },
//   { originalIndex: 0, score: 0.3, document: 'sunny day at the beach' }
// ]
```

### Structured Document Reranking

Reranking also supports structured documents, making it ideal for searching through databases, emails, or other structured content:

```typescript
import { rerank } from 'ai';
import { cohere } from '@ai-sdk/cohere';

const documents = [
  {
    from: 'Paul Doe',
    subject: 'Follow-up',
    text: 'We are happy to give you a discount of 20% on your next order.',
  },
  {
    from: 'John McGill',
    subject: 'Missing Info',
    text: 'Sorry, but here is the pricing information from Oracle: $5000/month',
  },
];

const { rerankedDocuments } = await rerank({
  model: cohere.reranking('rerank-v3.5'),
  documents,
  query: 'Which pricing did we get from Oracle?',
  topN: 1,
});

console.log(rerankedDocuments[0]);
// { from: 'John McGill', subject: 'Missing Info', text: '...' }
```

### Supported Providers

Several providers offer reranking models:

- [Cohere](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/cohere#reranking-models)
- [Amazon Bedrock](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/amazon-bedrock#reranking-models)
- [Together.ai](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/togetherai#reranking-models)

## Image Editing Support

Native support for image editing and generation workflows is coming soon. This will enable:

- Image-to-image transformations
- Multi-modal editing with text prompts

## Migration from AI SDK 5.x

AI SDK 6 is expected to have minimal breaking changes. The version bump is due to the v3 Language Model Specification, but most AI SDK 5 code will work with little or no modification.

## Timeline

**AI SDK 6 Beta**: Available now

**Stable Release**: End of 2025

# Agents

Agents are **large language models (LLMs)** that use **tools** in a **loop** to accomplish tasks.

These components work together:

- **LLMs** process input and decide the next action
- **Tools** extend capabilities beyond text generation (reading files, calling APIs, writing to databases)
- **Loop** orchestrates execution through:
  - **Context management** - Maintaining conversation history and deciding what the model sees (input) at each step
  - **Stopping conditions** - Determining when the loop (task) is complete

## ToolLoopAgent Class

The ToolLoopAgent class handles these three components. Here's an agent that uses multiple tools in a loop to accomplish a task:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent, stepCountIs, tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const weatherAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location (in Fahrenheit)',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
    convertFahrenheitToCelsius: tool({
      description: 'Convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        temperature: z.number().describe('Temperature in Fahrenheit'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ temperature }) => {
        const celsius = Math.round((temperature - 32) * (5 / 9));
        return { celsius };
      },
    }),
  },
  // Agent's default behavior is to stop after a maximum of 20 steps
  // stopWhen: stepCountIs(20),
});

const result = await weatherAgent.generate({
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco in celsius?',
});

console.log(result.text); // agent's final answer
console.log(result.steps); // steps taken by the agent
```

The agent automatically:

1. Calls the `weather` tool to get the temperature in Fahrenheit
2. Calls `convertFahrenheitToCelsius` to convert it
3. Generates a final text response with the result

The Agent class handles the loop, context management, and stopping conditions.

## Why Use the Agent Class?

The Agent class is the recommended approach for building agents with the AI SDK because it:

- **Reduces boilerplate** - Manages loops and message arrays
- **Improves reusability** - Define once, use throughout your application
- **Simplifies maintenance** - Single place to update agent configuration

For most use cases, start with the Agent class. Use core functions (`generateText`, `streamText`) when you need explicit control over each step for complex structured workflows.

## Structured Workflows

Agents are flexible and powerful, but non-deterministic. When you need reliable, repeatable outcomes with explicit control flow, use core functions with structured workflow patterns combining:

- Conditional statements for explicit branching
- Standard functions for reusable logic
- Error handling for robustness
- Explicit control flow for predictability

# Building Agents

The Agent class provides a structured way to encapsulate LLM configuration, tools, and behavior into reusable components. It handles the agent loop for you, allowing the LLM to call tools multiple times in sequence to accomplish complex tasks. Define agents once and use them across your application.

## Why Use the ToolLoopAgent Class?

When building AI applications, you often need to:

- **Reuse configurations** - Same model settings, tools, and prompts across different parts of your application
- **Maintain consistency** - Ensure the same behavior and capabilities throughout your codebase
- **Simplify API routes** - Reduce boilerplate in your endpoints
- **Type safety** - Get full TypeScript support for your agent's tools and outputs

The ToolLoopAgent class provides a single place to define your agent's behavior.

## Creating an Agent

Define an agent by instantiating the ToolLoopAgent class with your desired configuration:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';

const myAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
  tools: {
    // Your tools here
  },
});
```

## Configuration Options

The Agent class accepts all the same settings as `generateText` and `streamText`. Configure:

### Model and System Instructions

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  instructions: 'You are an expert software engineer.',
});
```

### Tools

Provide tools that the agent can use to accomplish tasks:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent, tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const codeAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  tools: {
    runCode: tool({
      description: 'Execute Python code',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        code: z.string(),
      }),
      execute: async ({ code }) => {
        // Execute code and return result
        return { output: 'Code executed successfully' };
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

### Loop Control

By default, agents run for 20 steps (`stopWhen: stepCountIs(20)`). In each step, the model either generates text or calls a tool. If it generates text, the agent completes. If it calls a tool, the AI SDK executes that tool.

To let agents call multiple tools in sequence, configure `stopWhen` to allow more steps. After each tool execution, the agent triggers a new generation where the model can call another tool or generate text:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent, stepCountIs } from 'ai';

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(20), // Allow up to 20 steps
});
```

Each step represents one generation (which results in either text or a tool call). The loop continues until:

- A finish reasoning other than tool-calls is returned, or
- A tool that is invoked does not have an execute function, or
- A tool call needs approval, or
- A stop condition is met

You can combine multiple conditions:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent, stepCountIs } from 'ai';

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  stopWhen: [
    stepCountIs(20), // Maximum 20 steps
    yourCustomCondition(), // Custom logic for when to stop
  ],
});
```

Learn more about [loop control and stop conditions](/docs/agents/loop-control).

### Tool Choice

Control how the agent uses tools:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  tools: {
    // your tools here
  },
  toolChoice: 'required', // Force tool use
  // or toolChoice: 'none' to disable tools
  // or toolChoice: 'auto' (default) to let the model decide
});
```

You can also force the use of a specific tool:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  tools: {
    weather: weatherTool,
    cityAttractions: attractionsTool,
  },
  toolChoice: {
    type: 'tool',
    toolName: 'weather', // Force the weather tool to be used
  },
});
```

### Structured Output

Define structured output schemas:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent, Output, stepCountIs } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const analysisAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  output: Output.object({
    schema: z.object({
      sentiment: z.enum(['positive', 'neutral', 'negative']),
      summary: z.string(),
      keyPoints: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(10),
});

const { output } = await analysisAgent.generate({
  prompt: 'Analyze customer feedback from the last quarter',
});
```

## Define Agent Behavior with System Instructions

System instructions define your agent's behavior, personality, and constraints. They set the context for all interactions and guide how the agent responds to user queries and uses tools.

### Basic System Instructions

Set the agent's role and expertise:

```ts
const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  instructions:
    'You are an expert data analyst. You provide clear insights from complex data.',
});
```

### Detailed Behavioral Instructions

Provide specific guidelines for agent behavior:

```ts
const codeReviewAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  instructions: `You are a senior software engineer conducting code reviews.

  Your approach:
  - Focus on security vulnerabilities first
  - Identify performance bottlenecks
  - Suggest improvements for readability and maintainability
  - Be constructive and educational in your feedback
  - Always explain why something is an issue and how to fix it`,
});
```

### Constrain Agent Behavior

Set boundaries and ensure consistent behavior:

```ts
const customerSupportAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  instructions: `You are a customer support specialist for an e-commerce platform.

  Rules:
  - Never make promises about refunds without checking the policy
  - Always be empathetic and professional
  - If you don't know something, say so and offer to escalate
  - Keep responses concise and actionable
  - Never share internal company information`,
  tools: {
    checkOrderStatus,
    lookupPolicy,
    createTicket,
  },
});
```

### Tool Usage Instructions

Guide how the agent should use available tools:

```ts
const researchAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  instructions: `You are a research assistant with access to search and document tools.

  When researching:
  1. Always start with a broad search to understand the topic
  2. Use document analysis for detailed information
  3. Cross-reference multiple sources before drawing conclusions
  4. Cite your sources when presenting information
  5. If information conflicts, present both viewpoints`,
  tools: {
    webSearch,
    analyzeDocument,
    extractQuotes,
  },
});
```

### Format and Style Instructions

Control the output format and communication style:

```ts
const technicalWriterAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  instructions: `You are a technical documentation writer.

  Writing style:
  - Use clear, simple language
  - Avoid jargon unless necessary
  - Structure information with headers and bullet points
  - Include code examples where relevant
  - Write in second person ("you" instead of "the user")

  Always format responses in Markdown.`,
});
```

## Using an Agent

Once defined, you can use your agent in three ways:

### Generate Text

Use `generate()` for one-time text generation:

```ts
const result = await myAgent.generate({
  prompt: 'What is the weather like?',
});

console.log(result.text);
```

### Stream Text

Use `stream()` for streaming responses:

```ts
const stream = myAgent.stream({
  prompt: 'Tell me a story',
});

for await (const chunk of stream.textStream) {
  console.log(chunk);
}
```

### Respond to UI Messages

Use `createAgentUIStreamResponse()` to create API responses for client applications:

```ts
// In your API route (e.g., app/api/chat/route.ts)
import { createAgentUIStreamResponse } from 'ai';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { messages } = await request.json();

  return createAgentUIStreamResponse({
    agent: myAgent,
    messages,
  });
}
```

## End-to-end Type Safety

You can infer types for your agent's `UIMessage`s:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent, InferAgentUIMessage } from 'ai';

const myAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  // ... configuration
});

// Infer the UIMessage type for UI components or persistence
export type MyAgentUIMessage = InferAgentUIMessage<typeof myAgent>;
```

Use this type in your client components with `useChat`:

```tsx filename="components/chat.tsx"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import type { MyAgentUIMessage } from '@/agent/my-agent';

export function Chat() {
  const { messages } = useChat<MyAgentUIMessage>();
  // Full type safety for your messages and tools
}
```

title: Workflow Patterns
description: Learn workflow patterns for building reliable agents with the AI SDK.

# Workflow Patterns

Combine the building blocks from the [overview](/docs/agents/overview) with these patterns to add structure and reliability to your agents:

- [Sequential Processing](#sequential-processing-chains) - Steps executed in order
- [Parallel Processing](#parallel-processing) - Independent tasks run simultaneously
- [Evaluation/Feedback Loops](#evaluator-optimizer) - Results checked and improved iteratively
- [Orchestration](#orchestrator-worker) - Coordinating multiple components
- [Routing](#routing) - Directing work based on context

## Choose Your Approach

Consider these key factors:

- **Flexibility vs Control** - How much freedom does the LLM need vs how tightly you must constrain its actions?
- **Error Tolerance** - What are the consequences of mistakes in your use case?
- **Cost Considerations** - More complex systems typically mean more LLM calls and higher costs
- **Maintenance** - Simpler architectures are easier to debug and modify

**Start with the simplest approach that meets your needs**. Add complexity only when required by:

1. Breaking down tasks into clear steps
2. Adding tools for specific capabilities
3. Implementing feedback loops for quality control
4. Introducing multiple agents for complex workflows

Let's look at examples of these patterns in action.

## Patterns with Examples

These patterns, adapted from [Anthropic's guide on building effective agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents), serve as building blocks you can combine to create comprehensive workflows. Each pattern addresses specific aspects of task execution. Combine them thoughtfully to build reliable solutions for complex problems.

## Sequential Processing (Chains)

The simplest workflow pattern executes steps in a predefined order. Each step's output becomes input for the next step, creating a clear chain of operations. Use this pattern for tasks with well-defined sequences, like content generation pipelines or data transformation processes.

```ts
import { generateText, generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

async function generateMarketingCopy(input: string) {
  const model = 'openai/gpt-4o';

  // First step: Generate marketing copy
  const { text: copy } = await generateText({
    model,
    prompt: `Write persuasive marketing copy for: ${input}. Focus on benefits and emotional appeal.`,
  });

  // Perform quality check on copy
  const { object: qualityMetrics } = await generateObject({
    model,
    schema: z.object({
      hasCallToAction: z.boolean(),
      emotionalAppeal: z.number().min(1).max(10),
      clarity: z.number().min(1).max(10),
    }),
    prompt: `Evaluate this marketing copy for:
    1. Presence of call to action (true/false)
    2. Emotional appeal (1-10)
    3. Clarity (1-10)

    Copy to evaluate: ${copy}`,
  });

  // If quality check fails, regenerate with more specific instructions
  if (
    !qualityMetrics.hasCallToAction ||
    qualityMetrics.emotionalAppeal < 7 ||
    qualityMetrics.clarity < 7
  ) {
    const { text: improvedCopy } = await generateText({
      model,
      prompt: `Rewrite this marketing copy with:
      ${!qualityMetrics.hasCallToAction ? '- A clear call to action' : ''}
      ${qualityMetrics.emotionalAppeal < 7 ? '- Stronger emotional appeal' : ''}
      ${qualityMetrics.clarity < 7 ? '- Improved clarity and directness' : ''}

      Original copy: ${copy}`,
    });
    return { copy: improvedCopy, qualityMetrics };
  }

  return { copy, qualityMetrics };
}
```

## Routing

This pattern lets the model decide which path to take through a workflow based on context and intermediate results. The model acts as an intelligent router, directing the flow of execution between different branches of your workflow. Use this when handling varied inputs that require different processing approaches. In the example below, the first LLM call's results determine the second call's model size and system prompt.

```ts
import { generateObject, generateText } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

async function handleCustomerQuery(query: string) {
  const model = 'openai/gpt-4o';

  // First step: Classify the query type
  const { object: classification } = await generateObject({
    model,
    schema: z.object({
      reasoning: z.string(),
      type: z.enum(['general', 'refund', 'technical']),
      complexity: z.enum(['simple', 'complex']),
    }),
    prompt: `Classify this customer query:
    ${query}

    Determine:
    1. Query type (general, refund, or technical)
    2. Complexity (simple or complex)
    3. Brief reasoning for classification`,
  });

  // Route based on classification
  // Set model and system prompt based on query type and complexity
  const { text: response } = await generateText({
    model:
      classification.complexity === 'simple'
        ? 'openai/gpt-4o-mini'
        : 'openai/o4-mini',
    system: {
      general:
        'You are an expert customer service agent handling general inquiries.',
      refund:
        'You are a customer service agent specializing in refund requests. Follow company policy and collect necessary information.',
      technical:
        'You are a technical support specialist with deep product knowledge. Focus on clear step-by-step troubleshooting.',
    }[classification.type],
    prompt: query,
  });

  return { response, classification };
}
```

## Parallel Processing

Break down tasks into independent subtasks that execute simultaneously. This pattern uses parallel execution to improve efficiency while maintaining the benefits of structured workflows. For example, analyze multiple documents or process different aspects of a single input concurrently (like code review).

```ts
import { generateText, generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

// Example: Parallel code review with multiple specialized reviewers
async function parallelCodeReview(code: string) {
  const model = 'openai/gpt-4o';

  // Run parallel reviews
  const [securityReview, performanceReview, maintainabilityReview] =
    await Promise.all([
      generateObject({
        model,
        system:
          'You are an expert in code security. Focus on identifying security vulnerabilities, injection risks, and authentication issues.',
        schema: z.object({
          vulnerabilities: z.array(z.string()),
          riskLevel: z.enum(['low', 'medium', 'high']),
          suggestions: z.array(z.string()),
        }),
        prompt: `Review this code:
      ${code}`,
      }),

      generateObject({
        model,
        system:
          'You are an expert in code performance. Focus on identifying performance bottlenecks, memory leaks, and optimization opportunities.',
        schema: z.object({
          issues: z.array(z.string()),
          impact: z.enum(['low', 'medium', 'high']),
          optimizations: z.array(z.string()),
        }),
        prompt: `Review this code:
      ${code}`,
      }),

      generateObject({
        model,
        system:
          'You are an expert in code quality. Focus on code structure, readability, and adherence to best practices.',
        schema: z.object({
          concerns: z.array(z.string()),
          qualityScore: z.number().min(1).max(10),
          recommendations: z.array(z.string()),
        }),
        prompt: `Review this code:
      ${code}`,
      }),
    ]);

  const reviews = [
    { ...securityReview.object, type: 'security' },
    { ...performanceReview.object, type: 'performance' },
    { ...maintainabilityReview.object, type: 'maintainability' },
  ];

  // Aggregate results using another model instance
  const { text: summary } = await generateText({
    model,
    system: 'You are a technical lead summarizing multiple code reviews.',
    prompt: `Synthesize these code review results into a concise summary with key actions:
    ${JSON.stringify(reviews, null, 2)}`,
  });

  return { reviews, summary };
}
```

## Orchestrator-Worker

A primary model (orchestrator) coordinates the execution of specialized workers. Each worker optimizes for a specific subtask, while the orchestrator maintains overall context and ensures coherent results. This pattern excels at complex tasks requiring different types of expertise or processing.

```ts
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

async function implementFeature(featureRequest: string) {
  // Orchestrator: Plan the implementation
  const { object: implementationPlan } = await generateObject({
    model: 'openai/o4-mini',
    schema: z.object({
      files: z.array(
        z.object({
          purpose: z.string(),
          filePath: z.string(),
          changeType: z.enum(['create', 'modify', 'delete']),
        })
      ),
      estimatedComplexity: z.enum(['low', 'medium', 'high']),
    }),
    system:
      'You are a senior software architect planning feature implementations.',
    prompt: `Analyze this feature request and create an implementation plan:
    ${featureRequest}`,
  });

  // Workers: Execute the planned changes
  const fileChanges = await Promise.all(
    implementationPlan.files.map(async (file) => {
      // Each worker is specialized for the type of change
      const workerSystemPrompt = {
        create:
          'You are an expert at implementing new files following best practices and project patterns.',
        modify:
          'You are an expert at modifying existing code while maintaining consistency and avoiding regressions.',
        delete:
          'You are an expert at safely removing code while ensuring no breaking changes.',
      }[file.changeType];

      const { object: change } = await generateObject({
        model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
        schema: z.object({
          explanation: z.string(),
          code: z.string(),
        }),
        system: workerSystemPrompt,
        prompt: `Implement the changes for ${file.filePath} to support:
        ${file.purpose}

        Consider the overall feature context:
        ${featureRequest}`,
      });

      return {
        file,
        implementation: change,
      };
    })
  );

  return {
    plan: implementationPlan,
    changes: fileChanges,
  };
}
```

## Evaluator-Optimizer

Add quality control to workflows with dedicated evaluation steps that assess intermediate results. Based on the evaluation, the workflow proceeds, retries with adjusted parameters, or takes corrective action. This creates robust workflows capable of self-improvement and error recovery.

```ts
import { generateText, generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

async function translateWithFeedback(text: string, targetLanguage: string) {
  let currentTranslation = '';
  let iterations = 0;
  const MAX_ITERATIONS = 3;

  // Initial translation
  const { text: translation } = await generateText({
    model: 'openai/gpt-4o-mini', // use small model for first attempt
    system: 'You are an expert literary translator.',
    prompt: `Translate this text to ${targetLanguage}, preserving tone and cultural nuances:
    ${text}`,
  });

  currentTranslation = translation;

  // Evaluation-optimization loop
  while (iterations < MAX_ITERATIONS) {
    // Evaluate current translation
    const { object: evaluation } = await generateObject({
      model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5', // use a larger model to evaluate
      schema: z.object({
        qualityScore: z.number().min(1).max(10),
        preservesTone: z.boolean(),
        preservesNuance: z.boolean(),
        culturallyAccurate: z.boolean(),
        specificIssues: z.array(z.string()),
        improvementSuggestions: z.array(z.string()),
      }),
      system: 'You are an expert in evaluating literary translations.',
      prompt: `Evaluate this translation:

      Original: ${text}
      Translation: ${currentTranslation}

      Consider:
      1. Overall quality
      2. Preservation of tone
      3. Preservation of nuance
      4. Cultural accuracy`,
    });

    // Check if quality meets threshold
    if (
      evaluation.qualityScore >= 8 &&
      evaluation.preservesTone &&
      evaluation.preservesNuance &&
      evaluation.culturallyAccurate
    ) {
      break;
    }

    // Generate improved translation based on feedback
    const { text: improvedTranslation } = await generateText({
      model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5', // use a larger model
      system: 'You are an expert literary translator.',
      prompt: `Improve this translation based on the following feedback:
      ${evaluation.specificIssues.join('\n')}
      ${evaluation.improvementSuggestions.join('\n')}

      Original: ${text}
      Current Translation: ${currentTranslation}`,
    });

    currentTranslation = improvedTranslation;
    iterations++;
  }

  return {
    finalTranslation: currentTranslation,
    iterationsRequired: iterations,
  };
}
```

title: Loop Control
description: Control agent execution with built-in loop management using stopWhen and prepareStep

---

# Loop Control

You can control both the execution flow and the settings at each step of the agent loop. The loop continues until:

- A finish reasoning other than tool-calls is returned, or
- A tool that is invoked does not have an execute function, or
- A tool call needs approval, or
- A stop condition is met

The AI SDK provides built-in loop control through two parameters: `stopWhen` for defining stopping conditions and `prepareStep` for modifying settings (model, tools, messages, and more) between steps.

## Stop Conditions

The `stopWhen` parameter controls when to stop execution when there are tool results in the last step. By default, agents stop after 20 steps using `stepCountIs(20)`.

When you provide `stopWhen`, the agent continues executing after tool calls until a stopping condition is met. When the condition is an array, execution stops when any of the conditions are met.

### Use Built-in Conditions

The AI SDK provides several built-in stopping conditions:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent, stepCountIs } from 'ai';

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  tools: {
    // your tools
  },
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(20), // Default state: stop after 20 steps maximum
});

const result = await agent.generate({
  prompt: 'Analyze this dataset and create a summary report',
});
```

### Combine Multiple Conditions

Combine multiple stopping conditions. The loop stops when it meets any condition:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent, stepCountIs, hasToolCall } from 'ai';

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  tools: {
    // your tools
  },
  stopWhen: [
    stepCountIs(20), // Maximum 20 steps
    hasToolCall('someTool'), // Stop after calling 'someTool'
  ],
});

const result = await agent.generate({
  prompt: 'Research and analyze the topic',
});
```

### Create Custom Conditions

Build custom stopping conditions for specific requirements:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent, StopCondition, ToolSet } from 'ai';

const tools = {
  // your tools
} satisfies ToolSet;

const hasAnswer: StopCondition<typeof tools> = ({ steps }) => {
  // Stop when the model generates text containing "ANSWER:"
  return steps.some((step) => step.text?.includes('ANSWER:')) ?? false;
};

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  tools,
  stopWhen: hasAnswer,
});

const result = await agent.generate({
  prompt: 'Find the answer and respond with "ANSWER: [your answer]"',
});
```

Custom conditions receive step information across all steps:

```ts
const budgetExceeded: StopCondition<typeof tools> = ({ steps }) => {
  const totalUsage = steps.reduce(
    (acc, step) => ({
      inputTokens: acc.inputTokens + (step.usage?.inputTokens ?? 0),
      outputTokens: acc.outputTokens + (step.usage?.outputTokens ?? 0),
    }),
    { inputTokens: 0, outputTokens: 0 }
  );

  const costEstimate =
    (totalUsage.inputTokens * 0.01 + totalUsage.outputTokens * 0.03) / 1000;
  return costEstimate > 0.5; // Stop if cost exceeds $0.50
};
```

## Prepare Step

The `prepareStep` callback runs before each step in the loop and defaults to the initial settings if you don't return any changes. Use it to modify settings, manage context, or implement dynamic behavior based on execution history.

### Dynamic Model Selection

Switch models based on step requirements:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o-mini', // Default model
  tools: {
    // your tools
  },
  prepareStep: async ({ stepNumber, messages }) => {
    // Use a stronger model for complex reasoning after initial steps
    if (stepNumber > 2 && messages.length > 10) {
      return {
        model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
      };
    }
    // Continue with default settings
    return {};
  },
});

const result = await agent.generate({
  prompt: '...',
});
```

### Context Management

Manage growing conversation history in long-running loops:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  tools: {
    // your tools
  },
  prepareStep: async ({ messages }) => {
    // Keep only recent messages to stay within context limits
    if (messages.length > 20) {
      return {
        messages: [
          messages[0], // Keep system instructions
          ...messages.slice(-10), // Keep last 10 messages
        ],
      };
    }
    return {};
  },
});

const result = await agent.generate({
  prompt: '...',
});
```

### Tool Selection

Control which tools are available at each step:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  tools: {
    search: searchTool,
    analyze: analyzeTool,
    summarize: summarizeTool,
  },
  prepareStep: async ({ stepNumber, steps }) => {
    // Search phase (steps 0-2)
    if (stepNumber <= 2) {
      return {
        activeTools: ['search'],
        toolChoice: 'required',
      };
    }

    // Analysis phase (steps 3-5)
    if (stepNumber <= 5) {
      return {
        activeTools: ['analyze'],
      };
    }

    // Summary phase (step 6+)
    return {
      activeTools: ['summarize'],
      toolChoice: 'required',
    };
  },
});

const result = await agent.generate({
  prompt: '...',
});
```

You can also force a specific tool to be used:

```ts
prepareStep: async ({ stepNumber }) => {
  if (stepNumber === 0) {
    // Force the search tool to be used first
    return {
      toolChoice: { type: 'tool', toolName: 'search' },
    };
  }

  if (stepNumber === 5) {
    // Force the summarize tool after analysis
    return {
      toolChoice: { type: 'tool', toolName: 'summarize' },
    };
  }

  return {};
};
```

### Message Modification

Transform messages before sending them to the model:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  tools: {
    // your tools
  },
  prepareStep: async ({ messages, stepNumber }) => {
    // Summarize tool results to reduce token usage
    const processedMessages = messages.map((msg) => {
      if (msg.role === 'tool' && msg.content.length > 1000) {
        return {
          ...msg,
          content: summarizeToolResult(msg.content),
        };
      }
      return msg;
    });

    return { messages: processedMessages };
  },
});

const result = await agent.generate({
  prompt: '...',
});
```

## Access Step Information

Both `stopWhen` and `prepareStep` receive detailed information about the current execution:

```ts
prepareStep: async ({
  model, // Current model configuration
  stepNumber, // Current step number (0-indexed)
  steps, // All previous steps with their results
  messages, // Messages to be sent to the model
}) => {
  // Access previous tool calls and results
  const previousToolCalls = steps.flatMap(step => step.toolCalls);
  const previousResults = steps.flatMap(step => step.toolResults);

  // Make decisions based on execution history
  if (previousToolCalls.some(call => call.toolName === 'dataAnalysis')) {
    return {
      toolChoice: { type: 'tool', toolName: 'reportGenerator' },
    };
  }

  return {};
},
```

## Manual Loop Control

For scenarios requiring complete control over the agent loop, you can use AI SDK Core functions (`generateText` and `streamText`) to implement your own loop management instead of using `stopWhen` and `prepareStep`. This approach provides maximum flexibility for complex workflows.

### Implementing a Manual Loop

Build your own agent loop when you need full control over execution:

```ts
import { generateText, ModelMessage } from 'ai';

const messages: ModelMessage[] = [{ role: 'user', content: '...' }];

let step = 0;
const maxSteps = 10;

while (step < maxSteps) {
  const result = await generateText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    messages,
    tools: {
      // your tools here
    },
  });

  messages.push(...result.response.messages);

  if (result.text) {
    break; // Stop when model generates text
  }

  step++;
}
```

This manual approach gives you complete control over:

- Message history management
- Step-by-step decision making
- Custom stopping conditions
- Dynamic tool and model selection
- Error handling and recovery

title: Configuring Call Options
description: Pass type-safe runtime inputs to dynamically configure agent behavior.

---

# Configuring Call Options

Call options allow you to pass type-safe structured inputs to your agent. Use them to dynamically modify any agent setting based on the specific request.

## Why Use Call Options?

When you need agent behavior to change based on runtime context:

- **Add dynamic context** - Inject retrieved documents, user preferences, or session data into prompts
- **Select models dynamically** - Choose faster or more capable models based on request complexity
- **Configure tools per request** - Pass user location to search tools or adjust tool behavior
- **Customize provider options** - Set reasoning effort, temperature, or other provider-specific settings

Without call options, you'd need to create multiple agents or handle configuration logic outside the agent.

## How It Works

Define call options in three steps:

1. **Define the schema** - Specify what inputs you accept using `callOptionsSchema`
2. **Configure with `prepareCall`** - Use those inputs to modify agent settings
3. **Pass options at runtime** - Provide the options when calling `generate()` or `stream()`

## Basic Example

Add user context to your agent's prompt at runtime:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const supportAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  callOptionsSchema: z.object({
    userId: z.string(),
    accountType: z.enum(['free', 'pro', 'enterprise']),
  }),
  instructions: 'You are a helpful customer support agent.',
  prepareCall: ({ options, ...settings }) => ({
    ...settings,
    instructions:
      settings.instructions +
      `\nUser context:
- Account type: ${options.accountType}
- User ID: ${options.userId}

Adjust your response based on the user's account level.`,
  }),
});

// Call the agent with specific user context
const result = await supportAgent.generate({
  prompt: 'How do I upgrade my account?',
  options: {
    userId: 'user_123',
    accountType: 'free',
  },
});
```

The `options` parameter is now required and type-checked. If you don't provide it or pass incorrect types, TypeScript will error.

## Modifying Agent Settings

Use `prepareCall` to modify any agent setting. Return only the settings you want to change.

### Dynamic Model Selection

Choose models based on request characteristics:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o-mini', // Default model
  callOptionsSchema: z.object({
    complexity: z.enum(['simple', 'complex']),
  }),
  prepareCall: ({ options, ...settings }) => ({
    ...settings,
    model:
      options.complexity === 'simple' ? 'openai/gpt-4o-mini' : 'openai/o1-mini',
  }),
});

// Use faster model for simple queries
await agent.generate({
  prompt: 'What is 2+2?',
  options: { complexity: 'simple' },
});

// Use more capable model for complex reasoning
await agent.generate({
  prompt: 'Explain quantum entanglement',
  options: { complexity: 'complex' },
});
```

### Dynamic Tool Configuration

Configure tools based on runtime context:

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const newsAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  callOptionsSchema: z.object({
    userCity: z.string().optional(),
    userRegion: z.string().optional(),
  }),
  tools: {
    web_search: openai.tools.webSearch(),
  },
  prepareCall: ({ options, ...settings }) => ({
    ...settings,
    tools: {
      web_search: openai.tools.webSearch({
        searchContextSize: 'low',
        userLocation: {
          type: 'approximate',
          city: options.userCity,
          region: options.userRegion,
          country: 'US',
        },
      }),
    },
  }),
});

await newsAgent.generate({
  prompt: 'What are the top local news stories?',
  options: {
    userCity: 'San Francisco',
    userRegion: 'California',
  },
});
```

### Provider-Specific Options

Configure provider settings dynamically:

```ts
import { openai, OpenAIProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'openai/o1-mini',
  callOptionsSchema: z.object({
    taskDifficulty: z.enum(['low', 'medium', 'high']),
  }),
  prepareCall: ({ options, ...settings }) => ({
    ...settings,
    providerOptions: {
      openai: {
        reasoningEffort: options.taskDifficulty,
      } satisfies OpenAIProviderOptions,
    },
  }),
});

await agent.generate({
  prompt: 'Analyze this complex scenario...',
  options: { taskDifficulty: 'high' },
});
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Fetch relevant context and inject it into your prompt:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const ragAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  callOptionsSchema: z.object({
    query: z.string(),
  }),
  prepareCall: async ({ options, ...settings }) => {
    // Fetch relevant documents (this can be async)
    const documents = await vectorSearch(options.query);

    return {
      ...settings,
      instructions: `Answer questions using the following context:

${documents.map((doc) => doc.content).join('\n\n')}`,
    };
  },
});

await ragAgent.generate({
  prompt: 'What is our refund policy?',
  options: { query: 'refund policy' },
});
```

The `prepareCall` function can be async, enabling you to fetch data before configuring the agent.

### Combining Multiple Modifications

Modify multiple settings together:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'openai/gpt-5-nano',
  callOptionsSchema: z.object({
    userRole: z.enum(['admin', 'user']),
    urgency: z.enum(['low', 'high']),
  }),
  tools: {
    readDatabase: readDatabaseTool,
    writeDatabase: writeDatabaseTool,
  },
  prepareCall: ({ options, ...settings }) => ({
    ...settings,
    // Upgrade model for urgent requests
    model:
      options.urgency === 'high'
        ? 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5'
        : settings.model,
    // Limit tools based on user role
    activeTools:
      options.userRole === 'admin'
        ? ['readDatabase', 'writeDatabase']
        : ['readDatabase'],
    // Adjust instructions
    instructions: `You are a ${options.userRole} assistant.
${
  options.userRole === 'admin'
    ? 'You have full database access.'
    : 'You have read-only access.'
}`,
  }),
});

await agent.generate({
  prompt: 'Update the user record',
  options: {
    userRole: 'admin',
    urgency: 'high',
  },
});
```

## Using with createAgentUIStreamResponse

Pass call options through API routes to your agent:

```ts filename="app/api/chat/route.ts"
import { createAgentUIStreamResponse } from 'ai';
import { myAgent } from '@/ai/agents/my-agent';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { messages, userId, accountType } = await request.json();

  return createAgentUIStreamResponse({
    agent: myAgent,
    messages,
    options: {
      userId,
      accountType,
    },
  });
}
```

# AI SDK Core

Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced programs that can understand, create, and engage with human language on a large scale.
They are trained on vast amounts of written material to recognize patterns in language and predict what might come next in a given piece of text.

AI SDK Core **simplifies working with LLMs by offering a standardized way of integrating them into your app** - so you can focus on building great AI applications for your users, not waste time on technical details.

For example, here’s how you can generate text with various models using the AI SDK:

<PreviewSwitchProviders />

## AI SDK Core Functions

AI SDK Core has various functions designed for [text generation](./generating-text), [structured data generation](./generating-structured-data), and [tool usage](./tools-and-tool-calling).
These functions take a standardized approach to setting up [prompts](./prompts) and [settings](./settings), making it easier to work with different models.

- [`generateText`](/docs/ai-sdk-core/generating-text): Generates text and [tool calls](./tools-and-tool-calling).
  This function is ideal for non-interactive use cases such as automation tasks where you need to write text (e.g. drafting email or summarizing web pages) and for agents that use tools.
- [`streamText`](/docs/ai-sdk-core/generating-text): Stream text and tool calls.
  You can use the `streamText` function for interactive use cases such as [chat bots](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot) and [content streaming](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/completion).
- [`generateObject`](/docs/ai-sdk-core/generating-structured-data): Generates a typed, structured object that matches a [Zod](https://zod.dev/) schema.
  You can use this function to force the language model to return structured data, e.g. for information extraction, synthetic data generation, or classification tasks.
- [`streamObject`](/docs/ai-sdk-core/generating-structured-data): Stream a structured object that matches a Zod schema.
  You can use this function to [stream generated UIs](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/object-generation).

## API Reference

Please check out the [AI SDK Core API Reference](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core) for more details on each function.

title: Generating Text
description: Learn how to generate text with the AI SDK.

# Generating and Streaming Text

Large language models (LLMs) can generate text in response to a prompt, which can contain instructions and information to process.
For example, you can ask a model to come up with a recipe, draft an email, or summarize a document.

The AI SDK Core provides two functions to generate text and stream it from LLMs:

- [`generateText`](#generatetext): Generates text for a given prompt and model.
- [`streamText`](#streamtext): Streams text from a given prompt and model.

Advanced LLM features such as [tool calling](./tools-and-tool-calling) and [structured data generation](./generating-structured-data) are built on top of text generation.

## `generateText`

You can generate text using the [`generateText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-text) function. This function is ideal for non-interactive use cases where you need to write text (e.g. drafting email or summarizing web pages) and for agents that use tools.

```tsx
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

You can use more [advanced prompts](./prompts) to generate text with more complex instructions and content:

```tsx
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  system:
    'You are a professional writer. ' +
    'You write simple, clear, and concise content.',
  prompt: `Summarize the following article in 3-5 sentences: ${article}`,
});
```

The result object of `generateText` contains several promises that resolve when all required data is available:

- `result.content`: The content that was generated in the last step.
- `result.text`: The generated text.
- `result.reasoning`: The full reasoning that the model has generated in the last step.
- `result.reasoningText`: The reasoning text of the model (only available for some models).
- `result.files`: The files that were generated in the last step.
- `result.sources`: Sources that have been used as references in the last step (only available for some models).
- `result.toolCalls`: The tool calls that were made in the last step.
- `result.toolResults`: The results of the tool calls from the last step.
- `result.finishReason`: The reason the model finished generating text.
- `result.usage`: The usage of the model during the final step of text generation.
- `result.totalUsage`: The total usage across all steps (for multi-step generations).
- `result.warnings`: Warnings from the model provider (e.g. unsupported settings).
- `result.request`: Additional request information.
- `result.response`: Additional response information, including response messages and body.
- `result.providerMetadata`: Additional provider-specific metadata.
- `result.steps`: Details for all steps, useful for getting information about intermediate steps.
- `result.output`: The generated structured output using the `output` specification.

### Accessing response headers & body

Sometimes you need access to the full response from the model provider,
e.g. to access some provider-specific headers or body content.

You can access the raw response headers and body using the `response` property:

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  // ...
});

console.log(JSON.stringify(result.response.headers, null, 2));
console.log(JSON.stringify(result.response.body, null, 2));
```

### `onFinish` callback

When using `generateText`, you can provide an `onFinish` callback that is triggered after the last step is finished (
[API Reference](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-text#on-finish)
).
It contains the text, usage information, finish reason, messages, steps, total usage, and more:

```tsx highlight="6-8"
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
  onFinish({ text, finishReason, usage, response, steps, totalUsage }) {
    // your own logic, e.g. for saving the chat history or recording usage

    const messages = response.messages; // messages that were generated
  },
});
```

## `streamText`

Depending on your model and prompt, it can take a large language model (LLM) up to a minute to finish generating its response. This delay can be unacceptable for interactive use cases such as chatbots or real-time applications, where users expect immediate responses.

AI SDK Core provides the [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text) function which simplifies streaming text from LLMs:

```ts
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = streamText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
});

// example: use textStream as an async iterable
for await (const textPart of result.textStream) {
  console.log(textPart);
}
```

<Note>
  `result.textStream` is both a `ReadableStream` and an `AsyncIterable`.
</Note>

<Note type="warning">
  `streamText` immediately starts streaming and suppresses errors to prevent
  server crashes. Use the `onError` callback to log errors.
</Note>

You can use `streamText` on its own or in combination with [AI SDK
UI](/examples/next-pages/basics/streaming-text-generation) and [AI SDK
RSC](/examples/next-app/basics/streaming-text-generation).
The result object contains several helper functions to make the integration into [AI SDK UI](/docs/ai-sdk-ui) easier:

- `result.toUIMessageStreamResponse()`: Creates a UI Message stream HTTP response (with tool calls etc.) that can be used in a Next.js App Router API route.
- `result.pipeUIMessageStreamToResponse()`: Writes UI Message stream delta output to a Node.js response-like object.
- `result.toTextStreamResponse()`: Creates a simple text stream HTTP response.
- `result.pipeTextStreamToResponse()`: Writes text delta output to a Node.js response-like object.

<Note>
  `streamText` is using backpressure and only generates tokens as they are
  requested. You need to consume the stream in order for it to finish.
</Note>

It also provides several promises that resolve when the stream is finished:

- `result.content`: The content that was generated in the last step.
- `result.text`: The generated text.
- `result.reasoning`: The full reasoning that the model has generated.
- `result.reasoningText`: The reasoning text of the model (only available for some models).
- `result.files`: Files that have been generated by the model in the last step.
- `result.sources`: Sources that have been used as references in the last step (only available for some models).
- `result.toolCalls`: The tool calls that have been executed in the last step.
- `result.toolResults`: The tool results that have been generated in the last step.
- `result.finishReason`: The reason the model finished generating text.
- `result.usage`: The usage of the model during the final step of text generation.
- `result.totalUsage`: The total usage across all steps (for multi-step generations).
- `result.warnings`: Warnings from the model provider (e.g. unsupported settings).
- `result.steps`: Details for all steps, useful for getting information about intermediate steps.
- `result.request`: Additional request information from the last step.
- `result.response`: Additional response information from the last step.
- `result.providerMetadata`: Additional provider-specific metadata from the last step.

### `onError` callback

`streamText` immediately starts streaming to enable sending data without waiting for the model.
Errors become part of the stream and are not thrown to prevent e.g. servers from crashing.

To log errors, you can provide an `onError` callback that is triggered when an error occurs.

```tsx highlight="6-8"
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = streamText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
  onError({ error }) {
    console.error(error); // your error logging logic here
  },
});
```

### `onChunk` callback

When using `streamText`, you can provide an `onChunk` callback that is triggered for each chunk of the stream.

It receives the following chunk types:

- `text`
- `reasoning`
- `source`
- `tool-call`
- `tool-input-start`
- `tool-input-delta`
- `tool-result`
- `raw`

```tsx highlight="6-11"
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = streamText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
  onChunk({ chunk }) {
    // implement your own logic here, e.g.:
    if (chunk.type === 'text') {
      console.log(chunk.text);
    }
  },
});
```

### `onFinish` callback

When using `streamText`, you can provide an `onFinish` callback that is triggered when the stream is finished (
[API Reference](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text#on-finish)
).
It contains the text, usage information, finish reason, messages, steps, total usage, and more:

```tsx highlight="6-8"
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = streamText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
  onFinish({ text, finishReason, usage, response, steps, totalUsage }) {
    // your own logic, e.g. for saving the chat history or recording usage

    const messages = response.messages; // messages that were generated
  },
});
```

### `fullStream` property

You can read a stream with all events using the `fullStream` property.
This can be useful if you want to implement your own UI or handle the stream in a different way.
Here is an example of how to use the `fullStream` property:

```tsx
import { streamText } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const result = streamText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  tools: {
    cityAttractions: {
      inputSchema: z.object({ city: z.string() }),
      execute: async ({ city }) => ({
        attractions: ['attraction1', 'attraction2', 'attraction3'],
      }),
    },
  },
  prompt: 'What are some San Francisco tourist attractions?',
});

for await (const part of result.fullStream) {
  switch (part.type) {
    case 'start': {
      // handle start of stream
      break;
    }
    case 'start-step': {
      // handle start of step
      break;
    }
    case 'text-start': {
      // handle text start
      break;
    }
    case 'text-delta': {
      // handle text delta here
      break;
    }
    case 'text-end': {
      // handle text end
      break;
    }
    case 'reasoning-start': {
      // handle reasoning start
      break;
    }
    case 'reasoning-delta': {
      // handle reasoning delta here
      break;
    }
    case 'reasoning-end': {
      // handle reasoning end
      break;
    }
    case 'source': {
      // handle source here
      break;
    }
    case 'file': {
      // handle file here
      break;
    }
    case 'tool-call': {
      switch (part.toolName) {
        case 'cityAttractions': {
          // handle tool call here
          break;
        }
      }
      break;
    }
    case 'tool-input-start': {
      // handle tool input start
      break;
    }
    case 'tool-input-delta': {
      // handle tool input delta
      break;
    }
    case 'tool-input-end': {
      // handle tool input end
      break;
    }
    case 'tool-result': {
      switch (part.toolName) {
        case 'cityAttractions': {
          // handle tool result here
          break;
        }
      }
      break;
    }
    case 'tool-error': {
      // handle tool error
      break;
    }
    case 'finish-step': {
      // handle finish step
      break;
    }
    case 'finish': {
      // handle finish here
      break;
    }
    case 'error': {
      // handle error here
      break;
    }
    case 'raw': {
      // handle raw value
      break;
    }
  }
}
```

### Stream transformation

You can use the `experimental_transform` option to transform the stream.
This is useful for e.g. filtering, changing, or smoothing the text stream.

The transformations are applied before the callbacks are invoked and the promises are resolved.
If you e.g. have a transformation that changes all text to uppercase, the `onFinish` callback will receive the transformed text.

#### Smoothing streams

The AI SDK Core provides a [`smoothStream` function](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/smooth-stream) that
can be used to smooth out text streaming.

```tsx highlight="6"
import { smoothStream, streamText } from 'ai';

const result = streamText({
  model,
  prompt,
  experimental_transform: smoothStream(),
});
```

#### Custom transformations

You can also implement your own custom transformations.
The transformation function receives the tools that are available to the model,
and returns a function that is used to transform the stream.
Tools can either be generic or limited to the tools that you are using.

Here is an example of how to implement a custom transformation that converts
all text to uppercase:

```ts
const upperCaseTransform =
  <TOOLS extends ToolSet>() =>
  (options: { tools: TOOLS; stopStream: () => void }) =>
    new TransformStream<TextStreamPart<TOOLS>, TextStreamPart<TOOLS>>({
      transform(chunk, controller) {
        controller.enqueue(
          // for text chunks, convert the text to uppercase:
          chunk.type === 'text'
            ? { ...chunk, text: chunk.text.toUpperCase() }
            : chunk
        );
      },
    });
```

You can also stop the stream using the `stopStream` function.
This is e.g. useful if you want to stop the stream when model guardrails are violated, e.g. by generating inappropriate content.

When you invoke `stopStream`, it is important to simulate the `step-finish` and `finish` events to guarantee that a well-formed stream is returned
and all callbacks are invoked.

```ts
const stopWordTransform =
  <TOOLS extends ToolSet>() =>
  ({ stopStream }: { stopStream: () => void }) =>
    new TransformStream<TextStreamPart<TOOLS>, TextStreamPart<TOOLS>>({
      // note: this is a simplified transformation for testing;
      // in a real-world version more there would need to be
      // stream buffering and scanning to correctly emit prior text
      // and to detect all STOP occurrences.
      transform(chunk, controller) {
        if (chunk.type !== 'text') {
          controller.enqueue(chunk);
          return;
        }

        if (chunk.text.includes('STOP')) {
          // stop the stream
          stopStream();

          // simulate the finish-step event
          controller.enqueue({
            type: 'finish-step',
            finishReason: 'stop',
            logprobs: undefined,
            usage: {
              completionTokens: NaN,
              promptTokens: NaN,
              totalTokens: NaN,
            },
            request: {},
            response: {
              id: 'response-id',
              modelId: 'mock-model-id',
              timestamp: new Date(0),
            },
            warnings: [],
            isContinued: false,
          });

          // simulate the finish event
          controller.enqueue({
            type: 'finish',
            finishReason: 'stop',
            logprobs: undefined,
            usage: {
              completionTokens: NaN,
              promptTokens: NaN,
              totalTokens: NaN,
            },
            response: {
              id: 'response-id',
              modelId: 'mock-model-id',
              timestamp: new Date(0),
            },
          });

          return;
        }

        controller.enqueue(chunk);
      },
    });
```

#### Multiple transformations

You can also provide multiple transformations. They are applied in the order they are provided.

```tsx highlight="4"
const result = streamText({
  model,
  prompt,
  experimental_transform: [firstTransform, secondTransform],
});
```

## Sources

Some providers such as [Perplexity](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/perplexity#sources) and
[Google Generative AI](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/google-generative-ai#sources) include sources in the response.

Currently sources are limited to web pages that ground the response.
You can access them using the `sources` property of the result.

Each `url` source contains the following properties:

- `id`: The ID of the source.
- `url`: The URL of the source.
- `title`: The optional title of the source.
- `providerMetadata`: Provider metadata for the source.

When you use `generateText`, you can access the sources using the `sources` property:

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: 'google/gemini-2.5-flash',
  tools: {
    google_search: google.tools.googleSearch({}),
  },
  prompt: 'List the top 5 San Francisco news from the past week.',
});

for (const source of result.sources) {
  if (source.sourceType === 'url') {
    console.log('ID:', source.id);
    console.log('Title:', source.title);
    console.log('URL:', source.url);
    console.log('Provider metadata:', source.providerMetadata);
    console.log();
  }
}
```

When you use `streamText`, you can access the sources using the `fullStream` property:

```tsx
const result = streamText({
  model: 'google/gemini-2.5-flash',
  tools: {
    google_search: google.tools.googleSearch({}),
  },
  prompt: 'List the top 5 San Francisco news from the past week.',
});

for await (const part of result.fullStream) {
  if (part.type === 'source' && part.sourceType === 'url') {
    console.log('ID:', part.id);
    console.log('Title:', part.title);
    console.log('URL:', part.url);
    console.log('Provider metadata:', part.providerMetadata);
    console.log();
  }
}
```

The sources are also available in the `result.sources` promise.

# Generating Structured Data

While text generation can be useful, your use case will likely call for generating structured data.
For example, you might want to extract information from text, classify data, or generate synthetic data.

Many language models are capable of generating structured data, often defined as using "JSON modes" or "tools".
However, you need to manually provide schemas and then validate the generated data as LLMs can produce incorrect or incomplete structured data.

The AI SDK standardises structured object generation across model providers
with the [`generateObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-object)
and [`streamObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-object) functions.
You can use both functions with different output strategies, e.g. `array`, `object`, `enum`, or `no-schema`,
and with different generation modes, e.g. `auto`, `tool`, or `json`.
You can use [Zod schemas](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/zod-schema), [Valibot](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/valibot-schema), or [JSON schemas](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/json-schema) to specify the shape of the data that you want,
and the AI model will generate data that conforms to that structure.

<Note>
  You can pass Zod objects directly to the AI SDK functions or use the
  `zodSchema` helper function.
</Note>

## Generate Object

The `generateObject` generates structured data from a prompt.
The schema is also used to validate the generated data, ensuring type safety and correctness.

```ts
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const { object } = await generateObject({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  schema: z.object({
    recipe: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      ingredients: z.array(z.object({ name: z.string(), amount: z.string() })),
      steps: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});
```

<Note>
  See `generateObject` in action with [these examples](#more-examples)
</Note>

### Accessing response headers & body

Sometimes you need access to the full response from the model provider,
e.g. to access some provider-specific headers or body content.

You can access the raw response headers and body using the `response` property:

```ts
import { generateObject } from 'ai';

const result = await generateObject({
  // ...
});

console.log(JSON.stringify(result.response.headers, null, 2));
console.log(JSON.stringify(result.response.body, null, 2));
```

## Stream Object

Given the added complexity of returning structured data, model response time can be unacceptable for your interactive use case.
With the [`streamObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-object) function, you can stream the model's response as it is generated.

```ts
import { streamObject } from 'ai';

const { partialObjectStream } = streamObject({
  // ...
});

// use partialObjectStream as an async iterable
for await (const partialObject of partialObjectStream) {
  console.log(partialObject);
}
```

You can use `streamObject` to stream generated UIs in combination with React Server Components (see [Generative UI](../ai-sdk-rsc))) or the [`useObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-object) hook.

<Note>See `streamObject` in action with [these examples](#more-examples)</Note>

### `onError` callback

`streamObject` immediately starts streaming.
Errors become part of the stream and are not thrown to prevent e.g. servers from crashing.

To log errors, you can provide an `onError` callback that is triggered when an error occurs.

```tsx highlight="5-7"
import { streamObject } from 'ai';

const result = streamObject({
  // ...
  onError({ error }) {
    console.error(error); // your error logging logic here
  },
});
```

## Output Strategy

You can use both functions with different output strategies, e.g. `array`, `object`, `enum`, or `no-schema`.

### Object

The default output strategy is `object`, which returns the generated data as an object.
You don't need to specify the output strategy if you want to use the default.

### Array

If you want to generate an array of objects, you can set the output strategy to `array`.
When you use the `array` output strategy, the schema specifies the shape of an array element.
With `streamObject`, you can also stream the generated array elements using `elementStream`.

```ts highlight="7,18"
import { streamObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const { elementStream } = streamObject({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  output: 'array',
  schema: z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    class: z
      .string()
      .describe('Character class, e.g. warrior, mage, or thief.'),
    description: z.string(),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate 3 hero descriptions for a fantasy role playing game.',
});

for await (const hero of elementStream) {
  console.log(hero);
}
```

### Enum

If you want to generate a specific enum value, e.g. for classification tasks,
you can set the output strategy to `enum`
and provide a list of possible values in the `enum` parameter.

<Note>Enum output is only available with `generateObject`.</Note>

```ts highlight="5-6"
import { generateObject } from 'ai';

const { object } = await generateObject({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  output: 'enum',
  enum: ['action', 'comedy', 'drama', 'horror', 'sci-fi'],
  prompt:
    'Classify the genre of this movie plot: ' +
    '"A group of astronauts travel through a wormhole in search of a ' +
    'new habitable planet for humanity."',
});
```

### No Schema

In some cases, you might not want to use a schema,
for example when the data is a dynamic user request.
You can use the `output` setting to set the output format to `no-schema` in those cases
and omit the schema parameter.

```ts highlight="6"
import { generateObject } from 'ai';

const { object } = await generateObject({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  output: 'no-schema',
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});
```

## Schema Name and Description

You can optionally specify a name and description for the schema. These are used by some providers for additional LLM guidance, e.g. via tool or schema name.

```ts highlight="6-7"
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const { object } = await generateObject({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  schemaName: 'Recipe',
  schemaDescription: 'A recipe for a dish.',
  schema: z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    ingredients: z.array(z.object({ name: z.string(), amount: z.string() })),
    steps: z.array(z.string()),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});
```

## Accessing Reasoning

You can access the reasoning used by the language model to generate the object via the `reasoning` property on the result. This property contains a string with the model's thought process, if available.

```ts
import { OpenAIResponsesProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const result = await generateObject({
  model: 'openai/gpt-5',
  schema: z.object({
    recipe: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      ingredients: z.array(
        z.object({
          name: z.string(),
          amount: z.string(),
        })
      ),
      steps: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      strictJsonSchema: true,
      reasoningSummary: 'detailed',
    } satisfies OpenAIResponsesProviderOptions,
  },
});

console.log(result.reasoning);
```

## Error Handling

When `generateObject` cannot generate a valid object, it throws a [`AI_NoObjectGeneratedError`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-errors/ai-no-object-generated-error).

This error occurs when the AI provider fails to generate a parsable object that conforms to the schema.
It can arise due to the following reasons:

- The model failed to generate a response.
- The model generated a response that could not be parsed.
- The model generated a response that could not be validated against the schema.

The error preserves the following information to help you log the issue:

- `text`: The text that was generated by the model. This can be the raw text or the tool call text, depending on the object generation mode.
- `response`: Metadata about the language model response, including response id, timestamp, and model.
- `usage`: Request token usage.
- `cause`: The cause of the error (e.g. a JSON parsing error). You can use this for more detailed error handling.

```ts
import { generateObject, NoObjectGeneratedError } from 'ai';

try {
  await generateObject({ model, schema, prompt });
} catch (error) {
  if (NoObjectGeneratedError.isInstance(error)) {
    console.log('NoObjectGeneratedError');
    console.log('Cause:', error.cause);
    console.log('Text:', error.text);
    console.log('Response:', error.response);
    console.log('Usage:', error.usage);
  }
}
```

## Repairing Invalid or Malformed JSON

<Note type="warning">
  The `repairText` function is experimental and may change in the future.
</Note>

Sometimes the model will generate invalid or malformed JSON.
You can use the `repairText` function to attempt to repair the JSON.

It receives the error, either a `JSONParseError` or a `TypeValidationError`,
and the text that was generated by the model.
You can then attempt to repair the text and return the repaired text.

```ts highlight="7-10"
import { generateObject } from 'ai';

const { object } = await generateObject({
  model,
  schema,
  prompt,
  experimental_repairText: async ({ text, error }) => {
    // example: add a closing brace to the text
    return text + '}';
  },
});
```

## Structured outputs with `generateText` and `streamText`

You can generate structured data with `generateText` and `streamText` by using the `output` setting.

<Note>
  Some models, e.g. those by OpenAI, support structured outputs and tool calling
  at the same time. This is only possible with `generateText` and `streamText`.
</Note>

### `generateText`

```ts highlight="2,4-18"
// output is a structured object that matches the schema:
const { output } = await generateText({
  // ...
  output: Output.object({
    schema: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      age: z.number().nullable().describe('Age of the person.'),
      contact: z.object({
        type: z.literal('email'),
        value: z.string(),
      }),
      occupation: z.object({
        type: z.literal('employed'),
        company: z.string(),
        position: z.string(),
      }),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate an example person for testing.',
});
```

### `streamText`

```ts highlight="2,4-18"
// partialOutputStream contains generated partial objects:
const { partialOutputStream } = await streamText({
  // ...
  output: Output.object({
    schema: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      age: z.number().nullable().describe('Age of the person.'),
      contact: z.object({
        type: z.literal('email'),
        value: z.string(),
      }),
      occupation: z.object({
        type: z.literal('employed'),
        company: z.string(),
        position: z.string(),
      }),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate an example person for testing.',
});
```

### Output Types

The AI SDK supports multiple ways of specifying the expected structure of generated data via the `Output` object. You can select from various strategies for structured/text generation and validation.

#### `Output.text()`

Use `Output.text()` to generate plain text from a model. This option doesn't enforce any schema on the result: you simply receive the model's text as a string.

```ts
const { output } = await generateText({
  // ...
  output: Output.text(),
  prompt: 'Tell me a joke.',
});
// output will be a string (the joke)
```

#### `Output.object()`

Use `Output.object({ schema })` to generate a structured object based on a schema (for example, a Zod schema). The output is type-validated to ensure the returned result matches the schema.

```ts
const { output } = await generateText({
  // ...
  output: Output.object({
    schema: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      age: z.number().nullable(),
      labels: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate information for a test user.',
});
// output will be an object matching the schema above
```

Partial outputs (e.g. with `streamText`) are also validated against your provided schema, as much as possible.

#### `Output.array()`

Use `Output.array({ element })` to specify that you expect an array of typed objects from the model, where each element should conform to a schema.

```ts
const { output } = await generateText({
  // ...
  output: Output.array({
    element: z.object({
      location: z.string(),
      temperature: z.number(),
      condition: z.string(),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'List the weather for San Francisco and Paris.',
});
// output will be an array of objects like:
// [
//   { location: 'San Francisco', temperature: 70, condition: 'Sunny' },
//   { location: 'Paris', temperature: 65, condition: 'Cloudy' },
// ]
```

With `Output.array`, the model is guided to return an object with an `elements` property that is an array; the SDK then extracts and validates this array for you.

For more advanced validation or different structures, see [the Output API reference](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/output).

#### `Output.choice()`

Use `Output.choice({ options })` when you expect the model to choose from a specific set of string options, such as for classification or fixed-enum answers.

```ts
const { output } = await generateText({
  // ...
  output: Output.choice({
    options: ['sunny', 'rainy', 'snowy'],
  }),
  prompt: 'Is the weather sunny, rainy, or snowy today?',
});
// output will be one of: 'sunny', 'rainy', or 'snowy'
```

You can provide any set of string options, and the output will always be a single string value that matches one of the specified options. The SDK validates that the result matches one of your options, and will throw if the model returns something invalid.

This is especially useful for making classification-style generations or forcing valid values for API compatibility.

#### `Output.json()`

Use `Output.json()` when you want to generate and parse unstructured JSON values from the model, without enforcing a specific schema. This is useful if you want to capture arbitrary objects, flexible structures, or when you want to rely on the model's natural output rather than rigid validation.

```ts
const { output } = await generateText({
  // ...
  output: Output.json(),
  prompt:
    'For each city, return the current temperature and weather condition as a JSON object.',
});

// output could be any valid JSON, for example:
// {
//   "San Francisco": { "temperature": 70, "condition": "Sunny" },
//   "Paris": { "temperature": 65, "condition": "Cloudy" }
// }
```

With `Output.json`, the SDK only checks that the response is valid JSON; it doesn't validate the structure or types of the values. If you need schema validation, use the `.object` or `.array` outputs instead.

This makes `Output.json()` ideal for custom or dynamic data structures, prototyping, working with unpredictable model output, or extracting information when you don't have a strict schema.

description: Learn about tool calling and multi-step calls (using stopWhen) with AI SDK Core.

# Tool Calling

As covered under Foundations, [tools](/docs/foundations/tools) are objects that can be called by the model to perform a specific task.
AI SDK Core tools contain three elements:

- **`description`**: An optional description of the tool that can influence when the tool is picked.
- **`inputSchema`**: A [Zod schema](/docs/foundations/tools#schemas) or a [JSON schema](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/json-schema) that defines the input parameters. The schema is consumed by the LLM, and also used to validate the LLM tool calls.
- **`execute`**: An optional async function that is called with the inputs from the tool call. It produces a value of type `RESULT` (generic type). It is optional because you might want to forward tool calls to the client or to a queue instead of executing them in the same process.

<Note className="mb-2">
  You can use the [`tool`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/tool) helper function to
  infer the types of the `execute` parameters.
</Note>

The `tools` parameter of `generateText` and `streamText` is an object that has the tool names as keys and the tools as values:

```ts highlight="6-17"
import { z } from 'zod';
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
  },
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco?',
});
```

<Note>
  When a model uses a tool, it is called a "tool call" and the output of the
  tool is called a "tool result".
</Note>

Tool calling is not restricted to only text generation.
You can also use it to render user interfaces (Generative UI).

## Multi-Step Calls (using stopWhen)

With the `stopWhen` setting, you can enable multi-step calls in `generateText` and `streamText`. When `stopWhen` is set and the model generates a tool call, the AI SDK will trigger a new generation passing in the tool result until there are no further tool calls or the stopping condition is met.

<Note>
  The `stopWhen` conditions are only evaluated when the last step contains tool
  results.
</Note>

By default, when you use `generateText` or `streamText`, it triggers a single generation. This works well for many use cases where you can rely on the model's training data to generate a response. However, when you provide tools, the model now has the choice to either generate a normal text response, or generate a tool call. If the model generates a tool call, its generation is complete and that step is finished.

You may want the model to generate text after the tool has been executed, either to summarize the tool results in the context of the users query. In many cases, you may also want the model to use multiple tools in a single response. This is where multi-step calls come in.

You can think of multi-step calls in a similar way to a conversation with a human. When you ask a question, if the person does not have the requisite knowledge in their common knowledge (a model's training data), the person may need to look up information (use a tool) before they can provide you with an answer. In the same way, the model may need to call a tool to get the information it needs to answer your question where each generation (tool call or text generation) is a step.

### Example

In the following example, there are two steps:

1. **Step 1**
   1. The prompt `'What is the weather in San Francisco?'` is sent to the model.
   1. The model generates a tool call.
   1. The tool call is executed.
1. **Step 2**
   1. The tool result is sent to the model.
   1. The model generates a response considering the tool result.

```ts highlight="18-19"
import { z } from 'zod';
import { generateText, tool, stepCountIs } from 'ai';

const { text, steps } = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
  },
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(5), // stop after a maximum of 5 steps if tools were called
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco?',
});
```

<Note>You can use `streamText` in a similar way.</Note>

### Steps

To access intermediate tool calls and results, you can use the `steps` property in the result object
or the `streamText` `onFinish` callback.
It contains all the text, tool calls, tool results, and more from each step.

#### Example: Extract tool results from all steps

```ts highlight="3,9-10"
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { steps } = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(10),
  // ...
});

// extract all tool calls from the steps:
const allToolCalls = steps.flatMap((step) => step.toolCalls);
```

### `onStepFinish` callback

When using `generateText` or `streamText`, you can provide an `onStepFinish` callback that
is triggered when a step is finished,
i.e. all text deltas, tool calls, and tool results for the step are available.
When you have multiple steps, the callback is triggered for each step.

```tsx highlight="5-7"
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  // ...
  onStepFinish({ text, toolCalls, toolResults, finishReason, usage }) {
    // your own logic, e.g. for saving the chat history or recording usage
  },
});
```

### `prepareStep` callback

The `prepareStep` callback is called before a step is started.

It is called with the following parameters:

- `model`: The model that was passed into `generateText`.
- `stopWhen`: The stopping condition that was passed into `generateText`.
- `stepNumber`: The number of the step that is being executed.
- `steps`: The steps that have been executed so far.
- `messages`: The messages that will be sent to the model for the current step.

You can use it to provide different settings for a step, including modifying the input messages.

```tsx highlight="5-7"
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  // ...
  prepareStep: async ({ model, stepNumber, steps, messages }) => {
    if (stepNumber === 0) {
      return {
        // use a different model for this step:
        model: modelForThisParticularStep,
        // force a tool choice for this step:
        toolChoice: { type: 'tool', toolName: 'tool1' },
        // limit the tools that are available for this step:
        activeTools: ['tool1'],
      };
    }

    // when nothing is returned, the default settings are used
  },
});
```

#### Message Modification for Longer Agentic Loops

In longer agentic loops, you can use the `messages` parameter to modify the input messages for each step. This is particularly useful for prompt compression:

```tsx
prepareStep: async ({ stepNumber, steps, messages }) => {
  // Compress conversation history for longer loops
  if (messages.length > 20) {
    return {
      messages: messages.slice(-10),
    };
  }

  return {};
},
```

## Response Messages

Adding the generated assistant and tool messages to your conversation history is a common task,
especially if you are using multi-step tool calls.

Both `generateText` and `streamText` have a `response.messages` property that you can use to
add the assistant and tool messages to your conversation history.
It is also available in the `onFinish` callback of `streamText`.

The `response.messages` property contains an array of `ModelMessage` objects that you can add to your conversation history:

```ts
import { generateText, ModelMessage } from 'ai';

const messages: ModelMessage[] = [
  // ...
];

const { response } = await generateText({
  // ...
  messages,
});

// add the response messages to your conversation history:
messages.push(...response.messages); // streamText: ...((await response).messages)
```

## Dynamic Tools

AI SDK Core supports dynamic tools for scenarios where tool schemas are not known at compile time. This is useful for:

- MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools without schemas
- User-defined functions at runtime
- Tools loaded from external sources

### Using dynamicTool

The `dynamicTool` helper creates tools with unknown input/output types:

```ts
import { dynamicTool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const customTool = dynamicTool({
  description: 'Execute a custom function',
  inputSchema: z.object({}),
  execute: async (input) => {
    // input is typed as 'unknown'
    // You need to validate/cast it at runtime
    const { action, parameters } = input as any;

    // Execute your dynamic logic
    return { result: `Executed ${action}` };
  },
});
```

### Type-Safe Handling

When using both static and dynamic tools, use the `dynamic` flag for type narrowing:

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  tools: {
    // Static tool with known types
    weather: weatherTool,
    // Dynamic tool
    custom: dynamicTool({
      /* ... */
    }),
  },
  onStepFinish: ({ toolCalls, toolResults }) => {
    // Type-safe iteration
    for (const toolCall of toolCalls) {
      if (toolCall.dynamic) {
        // Dynamic tool: input is 'unknown'
        console.log('Dynamic:', toolCall.toolName, toolCall.input);
        continue;
      }

      // Static tool: full type inference
      switch (toolCall.toolName) {
        case 'weather':
          console.log(toolCall.input.location); // typed as string
          break;
      }
    }
  },
});
```

## Preliminary Tool Results

You can return an `AsyncIterable` over multiple results.
In this case, the last value from the iterable is the final tool result.

This can be used in combination with generator functions to e.g. stream status information
during the tool execution:

```ts
tool({
  description: 'Get the current weather.',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    location: z.string(),
  }),
  async *execute({ location }) {
    yield {
      status: 'loading' as const,
      text: `Getting weather for ${location}`,
      weather: undefined,
    };

    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));

    const temperature = 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10;

    yield {
      status: 'success' as const,
      text: `The weather in ${location} is ${temperature}°F`,
      temperature,
    };
  },
});
```

## Tool Choice

You can use the `toolChoice` setting to influence when a tool is selected.
It supports the following settings:

- `auto` (default): the model can choose whether and which tools to call.
- `required`: the model must call a tool. It can choose which tool to call.
- `none`: the model must not call tools
- `{ type: 'tool', toolName: string (typed) }`: the model must call the specified tool

```ts highlight="18"
import { z } from 'zod';
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
  },
  toolChoice: 'required', // force the model to call a tool
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco?',
});
```

## Tool Execution Options

When tools are called, they receive additional options as a second parameter.

### Tool Call ID

The ID of the tool call is forwarded to the tool execution.
You can use it e.g. when sending tool-call related information with stream data.

```ts highlight="14-20"
import {
  streamText,
  tool,
  createUIMessageStream,
  createUIMessageStreamResponse,
} from 'ai';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();

  const stream = createUIMessageStream({
    execute: ({ writer }) => {
      const result = streamText({
        // ...
        messages,
        tools: {
          myTool: tool({
            // ...
            execute: async (args, { toolCallId }) => {
              // return e.g. custom status for tool call
              writer.write({
                type: 'data-tool-status',
                id: toolCallId,
                data: {
                  name: 'myTool',
                  status: 'in-progress',
                },
              });
              // ...
            },
          }),
        },
      });

      writer.merge(result.toUIMessageStream());
    },
  });

  return createUIMessageStreamResponse({ stream });
}
```

### Messages

The messages that were sent to the language model to initiate the response that contained the tool call are forwarded to the tool execution.
You can access them in the second parameter of the `execute` function.
In multi-step calls, the messages contain the text, tool calls, and tool results from all previous steps.

```ts highlight="8-9"
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  // ...
  tools: {
    myTool: tool({
      // ...
      execute: async (args, { messages }) => {
        // use the message history in e.g. calls to other language models
        return { ... };
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

### Abort Signals

The abort signals from `generateText` and `streamText` are forwarded to the tool execution.
You can access them in the second parameter of the `execute` function and e.g. abort long-running computations or forward them to fetch calls inside tools.

```ts highlight="6,11,14"
import { z } from 'zod';
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  abortSignal: myAbortSignal, // signal that will be forwarded to tools
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({ location: z.string() }),
      execute: async ({ location }, { abortSignal }) => {
        return fetch(
          `https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?q=${location}`,
          { signal: abortSignal } // forward the abort signal to fetch
        );
      },
    }),
  },
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco?',
});
```

### Context (experimental)

You can pass in arbitrary context from `generateText` or `streamText` via the `experimental_context` setting.
This context is available in the `experimental_context` tool execution option.

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  // ...
  tools: {
    someTool: tool({
      // ...
      execute: async (input, { experimental_context: context }) => {
        const typedContext = context as { example: string }; // or use type validation library
        // ...
      },
    }),
  },
  experimental_context: { example: '123' },
});
```

## Tool Input Lifecycle Hooks

The following tool input lifecycle hooks are available:

- **`onInputStart`**: Called when the model starts generating the input (arguments) for the tool call
- **`onInputDelta`**: Called for each chunk of text as the input is streamed
- **`onInputAvailable`**: Called when the complete input is available and validated

`onInputStart` and `onInputDelta` are only called in streaming contexts (when using `streamText`). They are not called when using `generateText`.

### Example

```ts highlight="15-23"
import { streamText, tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const result = streamText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  tools: {
    getWeather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
      onInputStart: () => {
        console.log('Tool call starting');
      },
      onInputDelta: ({ inputTextDelta }) => {
        console.log('Received input chunk:', inputTextDelta);
      },
      onInputAvailable: ({ input }) => {
        console.log('Complete input:', input);
      },
    }),
  },
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco?',
});
```

## Types

Modularizing your code often requires defining types to ensure type safety and reusability.
To enable this, the AI SDK provides several helper types for tools, tool calls, and tool results.

You can use them to strongly type your variables, function parameters, and return types
in parts of the code that are not directly related to `streamText` or `generateText`.

Each tool call is typed with `ToolCall<NAME extends string, ARGS>`, depending
on the tool that has been invoked.
Similarly, the tool results are typed with `ToolResult<NAME extends string, ARGS, RESULT>`.

The tools in `streamText` and `generateText` are defined as a `ToolSet`.
The type inference helpers `TypedToolCall<TOOLS extends ToolSet>`
and `TypedToolResult<TOOLS extends ToolSet>` can be used to
extract the tool call and tool result types from the tools.

```ts highlight="18-19,23-24"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { TypedToolCall, TypedToolResult, generateText, tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const myToolSet = {
  firstTool: tool({
    description: 'Greets the user',
    inputSchema: z.object({ name: z.string() }),
    execute: async ({ name }) => `Hello, ${name}!`,
  }),
  secondTool: tool({
    description: 'Tells the user their age',
    inputSchema: z.object({ age: z.number() }),
    execute: async ({ age }) => `You are ${age} years old!`,
  }),
};

type MyToolCall = TypedToolCall<typeof myToolSet>;
type MyToolResult = TypedToolResult<typeof myToolSet>;

async function generateSomething(prompt: string): Promise<{
  text: string;
  toolCalls: Array<MyToolCall>; // typed tool calls
  toolResults: Array<MyToolResult>; // typed tool results
}> {
  return generateText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    tools: myToolSet,
    prompt,
  });
}
```

## Handling Errors

The AI SDK has three tool-call related errors:

- [`NoSuchToolError`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-errors/ai-no-such-tool-error): the model tries to call a tool that is not defined in the tools object
- [`InvalidToolInputError`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-errors/ai-invalid-tool-input-error): the model calls a tool with inputs that do not match the tool's input schema
- [`ToolCallRepairError`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-errors/ai-tool-call-repair-error): an error that occurred during tool call repair

When tool execution fails (errors thrown by your tool's `execute` function), the AI SDK adds them as `tool-error` content parts to enable automated LLM roundtrips in multi-step scenarios.

### `generateText`

`generateText` throws errors for tool schema validation issues and other errors, and can be handled using a `try`/`catch` block. Tool execution errors appear as `tool-error` parts in the result steps:

```ts
try {
  const result = await generateText({
    //...
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (NoSuchToolError.isInstance(error)) {
    // handle the no such tool error
  } else if (InvalidToolInputError.isInstance(error)) {
    // handle the invalid tool inputs error
  } else {
    // handle other errors
  }
}
```

Tool execution errors are available in the result steps:

```ts
const { steps } = await generateText({
  // ...
});

// check for tool errors in the steps
const toolErrors = steps.flatMap((step) =>
  step.content.filter((part) => part.type === 'tool-error')
);

toolErrors.forEach((toolError) => {
  console.log('Tool error:', toolError.error);
  console.log('Tool name:', toolError.toolName);
  console.log('Tool input:', toolError.input);
});
```

### `streamText`

`streamText` sends errors as part of the full stream. Tool execution errors appear as `tool-error` parts, while other errors appear as `error` parts.

When using `toUIMessageStreamResponse`, you can pass an `onError` function to extract the error message from the error part and forward it as part of the stream response:

```ts
const result = streamText({
  // ...
});

return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse({
  onError: (error) => {
    if (NoSuchToolError.isInstance(error)) {
      return 'The model tried to call a unknown tool.';
    } else if (InvalidToolInputError.isInstance(error)) {
      return 'The model called a tool with invalid inputs.';
    } else {
      return 'An unknown error occurred.';
    }
  },
});
```

## Tool Call Repair

<Note type="warning">
  The tool call repair feature is experimental and may change in the future.
</Note>

Language models sometimes fail to generate valid tool calls,
especially when the input schema is complex or the model is smaller.

If you use multiple steps, those failed tool calls will be sent back to the LLM
in the next step to give it an opportunity to fix it.
However, you may want to control how invalid tool calls are repaired without requiring
additional steps that pollute the message history.

You can use the `experimental_repairToolCall` function to attempt to repair the tool call
with a custom function.

You can use different strategies to repair the tool call:

- Use a model with structured outputs to generate the inputs.
- Send the messages, system prompt, and tool schema to a stronger model to generate the inputs.
- Provide more specific repair instructions based on which tool was called.

### Example: Use a model with structured outputs for repair

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateObject, generateText, NoSuchToolError, tool } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model,
  tools,
  prompt,

  experimental_repairToolCall: async ({
    toolCall,
    tools,
    inputSchema,
    error,
  }) => {
    if (NoSuchToolError.isInstance(error)) {
      return null; // do not attempt to fix invalid tool names
    }

    const tool = tools[toolCall.toolName as keyof typeof tools];

    const { object: repairedArgs } = await generateObject({
      model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
      schema: tool.inputSchema,
      prompt: [
        `The model tried to call the tool "${toolCall.toolName}"` +
          ` with the following inputs:`,
        JSON.stringify(toolCall.input),
        `The tool accepts the following schema:`,
        JSON.stringify(inputSchema(toolCall)),
        'Please fix the inputs.',
      ].join('\n'),
    });

    return { ...toolCall, input: JSON.stringify(repairedArgs) };
  },
});
```

### Example: Use the re-ask strategy for repair

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateObject, generateText, NoSuchToolError, tool } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model,
  tools,
  prompt,

  experimental_repairToolCall: async ({
    toolCall,
    tools,
    error,
    messages,
    system,
  }) => {
    const result = await generateText({
      model,
      system,
      messages: [
        ...messages,
        {
          role: 'assistant',
          content: [
            {
              type: 'tool-call',
              toolCallId: toolCall.toolCallId,
              toolName: toolCall.toolName,
              input: toolCall.input,
            },
          ],
        },
        {
          role: 'tool' as const,
          content: [
            {
              type: 'tool-result',
              toolCallId: toolCall.toolCallId,
              toolName: toolCall.toolName,
              output: error.message,
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
      tools,
    });

    const newToolCall = result.toolCalls.find(
      (newToolCall) => newToolCall.toolName === toolCall.toolName
    );

    return newToolCall != null
      ? {
          toolCallType: 'function' as const,
          toolCallId: toolCall.toolCallId,
          toolName: toolCall.toolName,
          input: JSON.stringify(newToolCall.input),
        }
      : null;
  },
});
```

## Active Tools

Language models can only handle a limited number of tools at a time, depending on the model.
To allow for static typing using a large number of tools and limiting the available tools to the model at the same time,
the AI SDK provides the `activeTools` property.

It is an array of tool names that are currently active.
By default, the value is `undefined` and all tools are active.

```ts highlight="7"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  tools: myToolSet,
  activeTools: ['firstTool'],
});
```

## Multi-modal Tool Results

<Note type="warning">
  Multi-modal tool results are experimental and only supported by Anthropic and
  OpenAI.
</Note>

In order to send multi-modal tool results, e.g. screenshots, back to the model,
they need to be converted into a specific format.

AI SDK Core tools have an optional `toModelOutput` function
that converts the tool result into a content part.

Here is an example for converting a screenshot into a content part:

```ts highlight="22-27"
const result = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  tools: {
    computer: anthropic.tools.computer_20241022({
      // ...
      async execute({ action, coordinate, text }) {
        switch (action) {
          case 'screenshot': {
            return {
              type: 'image',
              data: fs
                .readFileSync('./data/screenshot-editor.png')
                .toString('base64'),
            };
          }
          default: {
            return `executed ${action}`;
          }
        }
      },

      // map to tool result content for LLM consumption:
      toModelOutput(result) {
        return {
          type: 'content',
          value:
            typeof result === 'string'
              ? [{ type: 'text', text: result }]
              : [{ type: 'media', data: result.data, mediaType: 'image/png' }],
        };
      },
    }),
  },
  // ...
});
```

## Extracting Tools

Once you start having many tools, you might want to extract them into separate files.
The `tool` helper function is crucial for this, because it ensures correct type inference.

Here is an example of an extracted tool:

```ts filename="tools/weather-tool.ts" highlight="1,4-5"
import { tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

// the `tool` helper function ensures correct type inference:
export const weatherTool = tool({
  description: 'Get the weather in a location',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
  }),
  execute: async ({ location }) => ({
    location,
    temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
  }),
});
```

## MCP Tools

The AI SDK supports connecting to Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to access their tools.
MCP enables your AI applications to discover and use tools across various services through a standardized interface.

For detailed information about MCP tools, including initialization, transport options, and usage patterns, see the [MCP Tools documentation](/docs/ai-sdk-core/mcp-tools).

### AI SDK Tools vs MCP Tools

In most cases, you should define your own AI SDK tools for production applications. They provide full control, type safety, and optimal performance. MCP tools are best suited for rapid development iteration and scenarios where users bring their own tools.

| Aspect                 | AI SDK Tools                                              | MCP Tools                                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type Safety**        | Full static typing end-to-end                             | Dynamic discovery at runtime                          |
| **Execution**          | Same process as your request (low latency)                | Separate server (network overhead)                    |
| **Prompt Control**     | Full control over descriptions and schemas                | Controlled by MCP server owner                        |
| **Schema Control**     | You define and optimize for your model                    | Controlled by MCP server owner                        |
| **Version Management** | Full visibility over updates                              | Can update independently (version skew risk)          |
| **Authentication**     | Same process, no additional auth required                 | Separate server introduces additional auth complexity |
| **Best For**           | Production applications requiring control and performance | Development iteration, user-provided tools            |

# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

<Note type="warning">
  The MCP tools feature is experimental and may change in the future.
</Note>

The AI SDK supports connecting to [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers to access their tools, resources, and prompts.
This enables your AI applications to discover and use capabilities across various services through a standardized interface.

<Note>
  If you're using OpenAI's Responses API, you can also use the built-in
  `openai.tools.mcp` tool, which provides direct MCP server integration without
  needing to convert tools. See the [OpenAI provider
  documentation](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/openai#mcp-tool) for details.
</Note>

## Initializing an MCP Client

We recommend using HTTP transport (like `StreamableHTTPClientTransport`) for production deployments. The stdio transport should only be used for connecting to local servers as it cannot be deployed to production environments.

Create an MCP client using one of the following transport options:

- **HTTP transport (Recommended)**: Either configure HTTP directly via the client using `transport: { type: 'http', ... }`, or use MCP's official TypeScript SDK `StreamableHTTPClientTransport`
- SSE (Server-Sent Events): An alternative HTTP-based transport
- `stdio`: For local development only. Uses standard input/output streams for local MCP servers

### HTTP Transport (Recommended)

For production deployments, we recommend using the HTTP transport. You can configure it directly on the client:

```typescript
import { experimental_createMCPClient as createMCPClient } from '@ai-sdk/mcp';

const mcpClient = await createMCPClient({
  transport: {
    type: 'http',
    url: 'https://your-server.com/mcp',

    // optional: configure HTTP headers
    headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer my-api-key' },

    // optional: provide an OAuth client provider for automatic authorization
    authProvider: myOAuthClientProvider,
  },
});
```

Alternatively, you can use `StreamableHTTPClientTransport` from MCP's official TypeScript SDK:

```typescript
import { experimental_createMCPClient as createMCPClient } from '@ai-sdk/mcp';
import { StreamableHTTPClientTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/streamableHttp.js';

const url = new URL('https://your-server.com/mcp');
const mcpClient = await createMCPClient({
  transport: new StreamableHTTPClientTransport(url, {
    sessionId: 'session_123',
  }),
});
```

### SSE Transport

SSE provides an alternative HTTP-based transport option. Configure it with a `type` and `url` property. You can also provide an `authProvider` for OAuth:

```typescript
import { experimental_createMCPClient as createMCPClient } from '@ai-sdk/mcp';

const mcpClient = await createMCPClient({
  transport: {
    type: 'sse',
    url: 'https://my-server.com/sse',

    // optional: configure HTTP headers
    headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer my-api-key' },

    // optional: provide an OAuth client provider for automatic authorization
    authProvider: myOAuthClientProvider,
  },
});
```

### Stdio Transport (Local Servers)

<Note type="warning">
  The stdio transport should only be used for local servers.
</Note>

The Stdio transport can be imported from either the MCP SDK or the AI SDK:

```typescript
import { experimental_createMCPClient as createMCPClient } from '@ai-sdk/mcp';
import { StdioClientTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio.js';
// Or use the AI SDK's stdio transport:
// import { Experimental_StdioMCPTransport as StdioClientTransport } from '@ai-sdk/mcp/mcp-stdio';

const mcpClient = await createMCPClient({
  transport: new StdioClientTransport({
    command: 'node',
    args: ['src/stdio/dist/server.js'],
  }),
});
```

### Custom Transport

You can also bring your own transport by implementing the `MCPTransport` interface for specific requirements not covered by the standard transports.

<Note>
  The client returned by the `experimental_createMCPClient` function is a
  lightweight client intended for use in tool conversion. It currently does not
  support all features of the full MCP client, such as: session
  management, resumable streams, and receiving notifications.

Authorization via OAuth is supported when using the AI SDK MCP HTTP or SSE
transports by providing an `authProvider`.

</Note>

### Closing the MCP Client

After initialization, you should close the MCP client based on your usage pattern:

- For short-lived usage (e.g., single requests), close the client when the response is finished
- For long-running clients (e.g., command line apps), keep the client open but ensure it's closed when the application terminates

When streaming responses, you can close the client when the LLM response has finished. For example, when using `streamText`, you should use the `onFinish` callback:

```typescript
const mcpClient = await experimental_createMCPClient({
  // ...
});

const tools = await mcpClient.tools();

const result = await streamText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  tools,
  prompt: 'What is the weather in Brooklyn, New York?',
  onFinish: async () => {
    await mcpClient.close();
  },
});
```

When generating responses without streaming, you can use try/finally or cleanup functions in your framework:

```typescript
let mcpClient: MCPClient | undefined;

try {
  mcpClient = await experimental_createMCPClient({
    // ...
  });
} finally {
  await mcpClient?.close();
}
```

## Using MCP Tools

The client's `tools` method acts as an adapter between MCP tools and AI SDK tools. It supports two approaches for working with tool schemas:

### Schema Discovery

With schema discovery, all tools offered by the server are automatically listed, and input parameter types are inferred based on the schemas provided by the server:

```typescript
const tools = await mcpClient.tools();
```

This approach is simpler to implement and automatically stays in sync with server changes. However, you won't have TypeScript type safety during development, and all tools from the server will be loaded

### Schema Definition

For better type safety and control, you can define the tools and their input schemas explicitly in your client code:

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

const tools = await mcpClient.tools({
  schemas: {
    'get-data': {
      inputSchema: z.object({
        query: z.string().describe('The data query'),
        format: z.enum(['json', 'text']).optional(),
      }),
    },
    // For tools with zero inputs, you should use an empty object:
    'tool-with-no-args': {
      inputSchema: z.object({}),
    },
  },
});
```

This approach provides full TypeScript type safety and IDE autocompletion, letting you catch parameter mismatches during development. When you define `schemas`, the client only pulls the explicitly defined tools, keeping your application focused on the tools it needs

## Using MCP Resources

According to the [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/server-concepts#resources), resources are **application-driven** data sources that provide context to the model. Unlike tools (which are model-controlled), your application decides when to fetch and pass resources as context.

The MCP client provides three methods for working with resources:

### Listing Resources

List all available resources from the MCP server:

```typescript
const resources = await mcpClient.listResources();
```

### Reading Resource Contents

Read the contents of a specific resource by its URI:

```typescript
const resourceData = await mcpClient.readResource({
  uri: 'file:///example/document.txt',
});
```

### Listing Resource Templates

Resource templates are dynamic URI patterns that allow flexible queries. List all available templates:

```typescript
const templates = await mcpClient.listResourceTemplates();
```

## Using MCP Prompts

According to the MCP specification, prompts are user-controlled templates that servers expose for clients to list and retrieve with optional arguments.

### Listing Prompts

```typescript
const prompts = await mcpClient.listPrompts();
```

### Getting a Prompt

Retrieve prompt messages, optionally passing arguments defined by the server:

```typescript
const prompt = await mcpClient.getPrompt({
  name: 'code_review',
  arguments: { code: 'function add(a, b) { return a + b; }' },
});
```

## Handling Elicitation Requests

Elicitation is a mechanism where MCP servers can request additional information from the client during tool execution. For example, a server might need user input to complete a registration form or confirmation for a sensitive operation.

<Note type="warning">
  It is up to the client application to handle elicitation requests properly.
  The MCP client simply surfaces these requests from the server to your
  application code.
</Note>

### Enabling Elicitation Support

To enable elicitation, you need to advertise the capability when creating the MCP client:

```typescript
const mcpClient = await experimental_createMCPClient({
  transport: {
    type: 'sse',
    url: 'https://your-server.com/sse',
  },
  capabilities: {
    elicitation: {},
  },
});
```

### Registering an Elicitation Handler

Use the `onElicitationRequest` method to register a handler that will be called when the server requests input:

```typescript
import { ElicitationRequestSchema } from '@ai-sdk/mcp';

mcpClient.onElicitationRequest(ElicitationRequestSchema, async (request) => {
  // request.params.message: A message describing what input is needed
  // request.params.requestedSchema: JSON schema defining the expected input structure

  // Get input from the user (implement according to your application's needs)
  const userInput = await getInputFromUser(
    request.params.message,
    request.params.requestedSchema
  );

  // Return the result with one of three actions:
  return {
    action: 'accept', // or 'decline' or 'cancel'
    content: userInput, // only required when action is 'accept'
  };
});
```

### Elicitation Response Actions

Your handler must return an object with an `action` field that can be one of:

- `'accept'`: User provided the requested information. Must include `content` with the data.
- `'decline'`: User chose not to provide the information.
- `'cancel'`: User cancelled the operation entirely.

# Prompt Engineering

## Tips

### Prompts for Tools

When you create prompts that include tools, getting good results can be tricky as the number and complexity of your tools increases.

Here are a few tips to help you get the best results:

1. Use a model that is strong at tool calling, such as `gpt-5` or `gpt-4.1`. Weaker models will often struggle to call tools effectively and flawlessly.
1. Keep the number of tools low, e.g. to 5 or less.
1. Keep the complexity of the tool parameters low. Complex Zod schemas with many nested and optional elements, unions, etc. can be challenging for the model to work with.
1. Use semantically meaningful names for your tools, parameters, parameter properties, etc. The more information you pass to the model, the better it can understand what you want.
1. Add `.describe("...")` to your Zod schema properties to give the model hints about what a particular property is for.
1. When the output of a tool might be unclear to the model and there are dependencies between tools, use the `description` field of a tool to provide information about the output of the tool execution.
1. You can include example input/outputs of tool calls in your prompt to help the model understand how to use the tools. Keep in mind that the tools work with JSON objects, so the examples should use JSON.

In general, the goal should be to give the model all information it needs in a clear way.

### Tool & Structured Data Schemas

The mapping from Zod schemas to LLM inputs (typically JSON schema) is not always straightforward, since the mapping is not one-to-one.

#### Zod Dates

Zod expects JavaScript Date objects, but models return dates as strings.
You can specify and validate the date format using `z.string().datetime()` or `z.string().date()`,
and then use a Zod transformer to convert the string to a Date object.

```ts highlight="7-10"
const result = await generateObject({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  schema: z.object({
    events: z.array(
      z.object({
        event: z.string(),
        date: z
          .string()
          .date()
          .transform((value) => new Date(value)),
      })
    ),
  }),
  prompt: 'List 5 important events from the year 2000.',
});
```

#### Optional Parameters

When working with tools that have optional parameters, you may encounter compatibility issues with certain providers that use strict schema validation.

<Note>
  This is particularly relevant for OpenAI models with structured outputs
  (strict mode).
</Note>

For maximum compatibility, optional parameters should use `.nullable()` instead of `.optional()`:

```ts highlight="6,7,16,17"
// This may fail with strict schema validation
const failingTool = tool({
  description: 'Execute a command',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    command: z.string(),
    workdir: z.string().optional(), // This can cause errors
    timeout: z.string().optional(),
  }),
});

// This works with strict schema validation
const workingTool = tool({
  description: 'Execute a command',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    command: z.string(),
    workdir: z.string().nullable(), // Use nullable instead
    timeout: z.string().nullable(),
  }),
});
```

#### Temperature Settings

For tool calls and object generation, it's recommended to use `temperature: 0` to ensure deterministic and consistent results:

```ts highlight="3"
const result = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  temperature: 0, // Recommended for tool calls
  tools: {
    myTool: tool({
      description: 'Execute a command',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        command: z.string(),
      }),
    }),
  },
  prompt: 'Execute the ls command',
});
```

Lower temperature values reduce randomness in model outputs, which is particularly important when the model needs to:

- Generate structured data with specific formats
- Make precise tool calls with correct parameters
- Follow strict schemas consistently

## Debugging

### Inspecting Warnings

Not all providers support all AI SDK features.
Providers either throw exceptions or return warnings when they do not support a feature.
To check if your prompt, tools, and settings are handled correctly by the provider, you can check the call warnings:

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});

console.log(result.warnings);
```

### HTTP Request Bodies

You can inspect the raw HTTP request bodies for models that expose them, e.g. [OpenAI](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/openai).
This allows you to inspect the exact payload that is sent to the model provider in the provider-specific way.

Request bodies are available via the `request.body` property of the response:

```ts highlight="6"
const result = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});

console.log(result.request.body);
```

# Settings

Large language models (LLMs) typically provide settings to augment their output.

All AI SDK functions support the following common settings in addition to the model, the [prompt](./prompts), and additional provider-specific settings:

```ts highlight="3-5"
const result = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  maxOutputTokens: 512,
  temperature: 0.3,
  maxRetries: 5,
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
});
```

<Note>
  Some providers do not support all common settings. If you use a setting with a
  provider that does not support it, a warning will be generated. You can check
  the `warnings` property in the result object to see if any warnings were
  generated.
</Note>

### `maxOutputTokens`

Maximum number of tokens to generate.

### `temperature`

Temperature setting.

The value is passed through to the provider. The range depends on the provider and model.
For most providers, `0` means almost deterministic results, and higher values mean more randomness.

It is recommended to set either `temperature` or `topP`, but not both.

<Note>In AI SDK 5.0, temperature is no longer set to `0` by default.</Note>

### `topP`

Nucleus sampling.

The value is passed through to the provider. The range depends on the provider and model.
For most providers, nucleus sampling is a number between 0 and 1.
E.g. 0.1 would mean that only tokens with the top 10% probability mass are considered.

It is recommended to set either `temperature` or `topP`, but not both.

### `topK`

Only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token.

Used to remove "long tail" low probability responses.
Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use `temperature`.

### `presencePenalty`

The presence penalty affects the likelihood of the model to repeat information that is already in the prompt.

The value is passed through to the provider. The range depends on the provider and model.
For most providers, `0` means no penalty.

### `frequencyPenalty`

The frequency penalty affects the likelihood of the model to repeatedly use the same words or phrases.

The value is passed through to the provider. The range depends on the provider and model.
For most providers, `0` means no penalty.

### `stopSequences`

The stop sequences to use for stopping the text generation.

If set, the model will stop generating text when one of the stop sequences is generated.
Providers may have limits on the number of stop sequences.

### `seed`

It is the seed (integer) to use for random sampling.
If set and supported by the model, calls will generate deterministic results.

### `maxRetries`

Maximum number of retries. Set to 0 to disable retries. Default: `2`.

### `abortSignal`

An optional abort signal that can be used to cancel the call.

The abort signal can e.g. be forwarded from a user interface to cancel the call,
or to define a timeout.

#### Example: Timeout

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
  abortSignal: AbortSignal.timeout(5000), // 5 seconds
});
```

### `headers`

Additional HTTP headers to be sent with the request. Only applicable for HTTP-based providers.

You can use the request headers to provide additional information to the provider,
depending on what the provider supports. For example, some observability providers support
headers such as `Prompt-Id`.

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
  headers: {
    'Prompt-Id': 'my-prompt-id',
  },
});
```

<Note>
  The `headers` setting is for request-specific headers. You can also set
  `headers` in the provider configuration. These headers will be sent with every
  request made by the provider.
</Note>

# Embeddings

Embeddings are a way to represent words, phrases, or images as vectors in a high-dimensional space.
In this space, similar words are close to each other, and the distance between words can be used to measure their similarity.

## Embedding a Single Value

The AI SDK provides the [`embed`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/embed) function to embed single values, which is useful for tasks such as finding similar words
or phrases or clustering text.
You can use it with embeddings models, e.g. `openai.textEmbeddingModel('text-embedding-3-large')` or `mistral.textEmbeddingModel('mistral-embed')`.

```tsx
import { embed } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

// 'embedding' is a single embedding object (number[])
const { embedding } = await embed({
  model: 'openai/text-embedding-3-small',
  value: 'sunny day at the beach',
});
```

## Embedding Many Values

When loading data, e.g. when preparing a data store for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
it is often useful to embed many values at once (batch embedding).

The AI SDK provides the [`embedMany`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/embed-many) function for this purpose.
Similar to `embed`, you can use it with embeddings models,
e.g. `openai.textEmbeddingModel('text-embedding-3-large')` or `mistral.textEmbeddingModel('mistral-embed')`.

```tsx
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { embedMany } from 'ai';

// 'embeddings' is an array of embedding objects (number[][]).
// It is sorted in the same order as the input values.
const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
  model: 'openai/text-embedding-3-small',
  values: [
    'sunny day at the beach',
    'rainy afternoon in the city',
    'snowy night in the mountains',
  ],
});
```

## Embedding Similarity

After embedding values, you can calculate the similarity between them using the [`cosineSimilarity`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/cosine-similarity) function.
This is useful to e.g. find similar words or phrases in a dataset.
You can also rank and filter related items based on their similarity.

```ts highlight={"2,10"}
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { cosineSimilarity, embedMany } from 'ai';

const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
  model: 'openai/text-embedding-3-small',
  values: ['sunny day at the beach', 'rainy afternoon in the city'],
});

console.log(
  `cosine similarity: ${cosineSimilarity(embeddings[0], embeddings[1])}`
);
```

## Token Usage

Many providers charge based on the number of tokens used to generate embeddings.
Both `embed` and `embedMany` provide token usage information in the `usage` property of the result object:

```ts highlight={"4,9"}
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { embed } from 'ai';

const { embedding, usage } = await embed({
  model: 'openai/text-embedding-3-small',
  value: 'sunny day at the beach',
});

console.log(usage); // { tokens: 10 }
```

## Settings

### Provider Options

Embedding model settings can be configured using `providerOptions` for provider-specific parameters:

```ts highlight={"5-9"}
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { embed } from 'ai';

const { embedding } = await embed({
  model: 'openai/text-embedding-3-small',
  value: 'sunny day at the beach',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      dimensions: 512, // Reduce embedding dimensions
    },
  },
});
```

### Parallel Requests

The `embedMany` function now supports parallel processing with configurable `maxParallelCalls` to optimize performance:

```ts highlight={"4"}
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { embedMany } from 'ai';

const { embeddings, usage } = await embedMany({
  maxParallelCalls: 2, // Limit parallel requests
  model: 'openai/text-embedding-3-small',
  values: [
    'sunny day at the beach',
    'rainy afternoon in the city',
    'snowy night in the mountains',
  ],
});
```

### Retries

Both `embed` and `embedMany` accept an optional `maxRetries` parameter of type `number`
that you can use to set the maximum number of retries for the embedding process.
It defaults to `2` retries (3 attempts in total). You can set it to `0` to disable retries.

```ts highlight={"7"}
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { embed } from 'ai';

const { embedding } = await embed({
  model: 'openai/text-embedding-3-small',
  value: 'sunny day at the beach',
  maxRetries: 0, // Disable retries
});
```

### Abort Signals and Timeouts

Both `embed` and `embedMany` accept an optional `abortSignal` parameter of
type [`AbortSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal)
that you can use to abort the embedding process or set a timeout.

```ts highlight={"7"}
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { embed } from 'ai';

const { embedding } = await embed({
  model: 'openai/text-embedding-3-small',
  value: 'sunny day at the beach',
  abortSignal: AbortSignal.timeout(1000), // Abort after 1 second
});
```

### Custom Headers

Both `embed` and `embedMany` accept an optional `headers` parameter of type `Record<string, string>`
that you can use to add custom headers to the embedding request.

```ts highlight={"7"}
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { embed } from 'ai';

const { embedding } = await embed({
  model: 'openai/text-embedding-3-small',
  value: 'sunny day at the beach',
  headers: { 'X-Custom-Header': 'custom-value' },
});
```

## Response Information

Both `embed` and `embedMany` return response information that includes the raw provider response:

```ts highlight={"4,9"}
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { embed } from 'ai';

const { embedding, response } = await embed({
  model: 'openai/text-embedding-3-small',
  value: 'sunny day at the beach',
});

console.log(response); // Raw provider response
```

## Embedding Middleware

You can enhance embedding models, e.g. to set default values, using
`wrapEmbeddingModel` and `EmbeddingModelV3Middleware`.

Here is an example that uses the built-in `defaultEmbeddingSettingsMiddleware`:

```ts
import {
  customProvider,
  defaultEmbeddingSettingsMiddleware,
  embed,
  wrapEmbeddingModel,
  gateway,
} from 'ai';

const embeddingModelWithDefaults = wrapEmbeddingModel({
  model: gateway.textEmbeddingModel('google/gemini-embedding-001'),
  middleware: defaultEmbeddingSettingsMiddleware({
    settings: {
      providerOptions: {
        google: {
          outputDimensionality: 256,
          taskType: 'CLASSIFICATION',
        },
      },
    },
  }),
});
```

## Embedding Providers & Models

Several providers offer embedding models:

title: Reranking
description: Learn how to rerank documents with the AI SDK.

# Reranking

Reranking is a technique used to improve search relevance by reordering a set of documents based on their relevance to a query.
Unlike embedding-based similarity search, reranking models are specifically trained to understand the relationship between queries and documents,
often producing more accurate relevance scores.

## Reranking Documents

The AI SDK provides the [`rerank`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/rerank) function to rerank documents based on their relevance to a query.
You can use it with reranking models, e.g. `cohere.reranking('rerank-v3.5')` or `bedrock.reranking('cohere.rerank-v3-5:0')`.

```tsx
import { rerank } from 'ai';
import { cohere } from '@ai-sdk/cohere';

const documents = [
  'sunny day at the beach',
  'rainy afternoon in the city',
  'snowy night in the mountains',
];

const { ranking } = await rerank({
  model: cohere.reranking('rerank-v3.5'),
  documents,
  query: 'talk about rain',
  topN: 2, // Return top 2 most relevant documents
});

console.log(ranking);
// [
//   { originalIndex: 1, score: 0.9, document: 'rainy afternoon in the city' },
//   { originalIndex: 0, score: 0.3, document: 'sunny day at the beach' }
// ]
```

## Working with Object Documents

Reranking also supports structured documents (JSON objects), making it ideal for searching through databases, emails, or other structured content:

```tsx
import { rerank } from 'ai';
import { cohere } from '@ai-sdk/cohere';

const documents = [
  {
    from: 'Paul Doe',
    subject: 'Follow-up',
    text: 'We are happy to give you a discount of 20% on your next order.',
  },
  {
    from: 'John McGill',
    subject: 'Missing Info',
    text: 'Sorry, but here is the pricing information from Oracle: $5000/month',
  },
];

const { ranking, rerankedDocuments } = await rerank({
  model: cohere.reranking('rerank-v3.5'),
  documents,
  query: 'Which pricing did we get from Oracle?',
  topN: 1,
});

console.log(rerankedDocuments[0]);
// { from: 'John McGill', subject: 'Missing Info', text: '...' }
```

## Understanding the Results

The `rerank` function returns a comprehensive result object:

```ts
import { cohere } from '@ai-sdk/cohere';
import { rerank } from 'ai';

const { ranking, rerankedDocuments, originalDocuments } = await rerank({
  model: cohere.reranking('rerank-v3.5'),
  documents: ['sunny day at the beach', 'rainy afternoon in the city'],
  query: 'talk about rain',
});

// ranking: sorted array of { originalIndex, score, document }
// rerankedDocuments: documents sorted by relevance (convenience property)
// originalDocuments: original documents array
```

Each item in the `ranking` array contains:

- `originalIndex`: Position in the original documents array
- `score`: Relevance score (typically 0-1, where higher is more relevant)
- `document`: The original document

## Settings

### Top-N Results

Use `topN` to limit the number of results returned. This is useful for retrieving only the most relevant documents:

```ts highlight={"7"}
import { cohere } from '@ai-sdk/cohere';
import { rerank } from 'ai';

const { ranking } = await rerank({
  model: cohere.reranking('rerank-v3.5'),
  documents: ['doc1', 'doc2', 'doc3', 'doc4', 'doc5'],
  query: 'relevant information',
  topN: 3, // Return only top 3 most relevant documents
});
```

### Provider Options

Reranking model settings can be configured using `providerOptions` for provider-specific parameters:

```ts highlight={"8-12"}
import { cohere } from '@ai-sdk/cohere';
import { rerank } from 'ai';

const { ranking } = await rerank({
  model: cohere.reranking('rerank-v3.5'),
  documents: ['sunny day at the beach', 'rainy afternoon in the city'],
  query: 'talk about rain',
  providerOptions: {
    cohere: {
      maxTokensPerDoc: 1000, // Limit tokens per document
    },
  },
});
```

### Retries

The `rerank` function accepts an optional `maxRetries` parameter of type `number`
that you can use to set the maximum number of retries for the reranking process.
It defaults to `2` retries (3 attempts in total). You can set it to `0` to disable retries.

```ts highlight={"7"}
import { cohere } from '@ai-sdk/cohere';
import { rerank } from 'ai';

const { ranking } = await rerank({
  model: cohere.reranking('rerank-v3.5'),
  documents: ['sunny day at the beach', 'rainy afternoon in the city'],
  query: 'talk about rain',
  maxRetries: 0, // Disable retries
});
```

### Abort Signals and Timeouts

The `rerank` function accepts an optional `abortSignal` parameter of
type [`AbortSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal)
that you can use to abort the reranking process or set a timeout.

```ts highlight={"7"}
import { cohere } from '@ai-sdk/cohere';
import { rerank } from 'ai';

const { ranking } = await rerank({
  model: cohere.reranking('rerank-v3.5'),
  documents: ['sunny day at the beach', 'rainy afternoon in the city'],
  query: 'talk about rain',
  abortSignal: AbortSignal.timeout(5000), // Abort after 5 seconds
});
```

### Custom Headers

The `rerank` function accepts an optional `headers` parameter of type `Record<string, string>`
that you can use to add custom headers to the reranking request.

```ts highlight={"7"}
import { cohere } from '@ai-sdk/cohere';
import { rerank } from 'ai';

const { ranking } = await rerank({
  model: cohere.reranking('rerank-v3.5'),
  documents: ['sunny day at the beach', 'rainy afternoon in the city'],
  query: 'talk about rain',
  headers: { 'X-Custom-Header': 'custom-value' },
});
```

## Response Information

The `rerank` function returns response information that includes the raw provider response:

```ts highlight={"4,10"}
import { cohere } from '@ai-sdk/cohere';
import { rerank } from 'ai';

const { ranking, response } = await rerank({
  model: cohere.reranking('rerank-v3.5'),
  documents: ['sunny day at the beach', 'rainy afternoon in the city'],
  query: 'talk about rain',
});

console.log(response); // { id, timestamp, modelId, headers, body }
```

## Reranking Providers & Models

Several providers offer reranking models:

| Provider                                                                      | Model                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |

# Image Generation

<Note type="warning">Image generation is an experimental feature.</Note>

The AI SDK provides the [`generateImage`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-image)
function to generate images based on a given prompt using an image model.

```tsx
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const { image } = await generateImage({
  model: openai.image('dall-e-3'),
  prompt: 'Santa Claus driving a Cadillac',
});
```

You can access the image data using the `base64` or `uint8Array` properties:

```tsx
const base64 = image.base64; // base64 image data
const uint8Array = image.uint8Array; // Uint8Array image data
```

## Settings

### Size and Aspect Ratio

Depending on the model, you can either specify the size or the aspect ratio.

##### Size

The size is specified as a string in the format `{width}x{height}`.
Models only support a few sizes, and the supported sizes are different for each model and provider.

```tsx highlight={"7"}
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const { image } = await generateImage({
  model: openai.image('dall-e-3'),
  prompt: 'Santa Claus driving a Cadillac',
  size: '1024x1024',
});
```

##### Aspect Ratio

The aspect ratio is specified as a string in the format `{width}:{height}`.
Models only support a few aspect ratios, and the supported aspect ratios are different for each model and provider.

```tsx highlight={"7"}
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';
import { vertex } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex';

const { image } = await generateImage({
  model: vertex.image('imagen-3.0-generate-002'),
  prompt: 'Santa Claus driving a Cadillac',
  aspectRatio: '16:9',
});
```

### Generating Multiple Images

`generateImage` also supports generating multiple images at once:

```tsx highlight={"7"}
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const { images } = await generateImage({
  model: openai.image('dall-e-2'),
  prompt: 'Santa Claus driving a Cadillac',
  n: 4, // number of images to generate
});
```

<Note>
  `generateImage` will automatically call the model as often as needed (in
  parallel) to generate the requested number of images.
</Note>

Each image model has an internal limit on how many images it can generate in a single API call. The AI SDK manages this automatically by batching requests appropriately when you request multiple images using the `n` parameter. By default, the SDK uses provider-documented limits (for example, DALL-E 3 can only generate 1 image per call, while DALL-E 2 supports up to 10).

If needed, you can override this behavior using the `maxImagesPerCall` setting when generating your image. This is particularly useful when working with new or custom models where the default batch size might not be optimal:

```tsx
const { images } = await generateImage({
  model: openai.image('dall-e-2'),
  prompt: 'Santa Claus driving a Cadillac',
  maxImagesPerCall: 5, // Override the default batch size
  n: 10, // Will make 2 calls of 5 images each
});
```

### Providing a Seed

You can provide a seed to the `generateImage` function to control the output of the image generation process.
If supported by the model, the same seed will always produce the same image.

```tsx highlight={"7"}
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const { image } = await generateImage({
  model: openai.image('dall-e-3'),
  prompt: 'Santa Claus driving a Cadillac',
  seed: 1234567890,
});
```

### Provider-specific Settings

Image models often have provider- or even model-specific settings.
You can pass such settings to the `generateImage` function
using the `providerOptions` parameter. The options for the provider
(`openai` in the example below) become request body properties.

```tsx highlight={"9"}
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const { image } = await generateImage({
  model: openai.image('dall-e-3'),
  prompt: 'Santa Claus driving a Cadillac',
  size: '1024x1024',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: { style: 'vivid', quality: 'hd' },
  },
});
```

### Abort Signals and Timeouts

`generateImage` accepts an optional `abortSignal` parameter of
type [`AbortSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal)
that you can use to abort the image generation process or set a timeout.

```ts highlight={"7"}
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';

const { image } = await generateImage({
  model: openai.image('dall-e-3'),
  prompt: 'Santa Claus driving a Cadillac',
  abortSignal: AbortSignal.timeout(1000), // Abort after 1 second
});
```

### Custom Headers

`generateImage` accepts an optional `headers` parameter of type `Record<string, string>`
that you can use to add custom headers to the image generation request.

```ts highlight={"7"}
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';

const { image } = await generateImage({
  model: openai.image('dall-e-3'),
  prompt: 'Santa Claus driving a Cadillac',
  headers: { 'X-Custom-Header': 'custom-value' },
});
```

### Warnings

If the model returns warnings, e.g. for unsupported parameters, they will be available in the `warnings` property of the response.

```tsx
const { image, warnings } = await generateImage({
  model: openai.image('dall-e-3'),
  prompt: 'Santa Claus driving a Cadillac',
});
```

### Additional provider-specific meta data

Some providers expose additional meta data for the result overall or per image.

```tsx
const prompt = 'Santa Claus driving a Cadillac';

const { image, providerMetadata } = await generateImage({
  model: openai.image('dall-e-3'),
  prompt,
});

const revisedPrompt = providerMetadata.openai.images[0]?.revisedPrompt;

console.log({
  prompt,
  revisedPrompt,
});
```

The outer key of the returned `providerMetadata` is the provider name. The inner values are the metadata. An `images` key is always present in the metadata and is an array with the same length as the top level `images` key.

### Error Handling

When `generateImage` cannot generate a valid image, it throws a [`AI_NoImageGeneratedError`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-errors/ai-no-image-generated-error).

This error occurs when the AI provider fails to generate an image. It can arise due to the following reasons:

- The model failed to generate a response
- The model generated a response that could not be parsed

The error preserves the following information to help you log the issue:

- `responses`: Metadata about the image model responses, including timestamp, model, and headers.
- `cause`: The cause of the error. You can use this for more detailed error handling

```ts
import { generateImage, NoImageGeneratedError } from 'ai';

try {
  await generateImage({ model, prompt });
} catch (error) {
  if (NoImageGeneratedError.isInstance(error)) {
    console.log('NoImageGeneratedError');
    console.log('Cause:', error.cause);
    console.log('Responses:', error.responses);
  }
}
```

## Generating Images with Language Models

Some language models such as Google `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` support multi-modal outputs including images.
With such models, you can access the generated images using the `files` property of the response.

```ts
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: google('gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview'),
  prompt: 'Generate an image of a comic cat',
});

for (const file of result.files) {
  if (file.mediaType.startsWith('image/')) {
    // The file object provides multiple data formats:
    // Access images as base64 string, Uint8Array binary data, or check type
    // - file.base64: string (data URL format)
    // - file.uint8Array: Uint8Array (binary data)
    // - file.mediaType: string (e.g. "image/png")
  }
}
```

# Transcription

<Note type="warning">Transcription is an experimental feature.</Note>

The AI SDK provides the [`transcribe`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/transcribe)
function to transcribe audio using a transcription model.

```ts
import { experimental_transcribe as transcribe } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';

const transcript = await transcribe({
  model: openai.transcription('whisper-1'),
  audio: await readFile('audio.mp3'),
});
```

The `audio` property can be a `Uint8Array`, `ArrayBuffer`, `Buffer`, `string` (base64 encoded audio data), or a `URL`.

To access the generated transcript:

```ts
const text = transcript.text; // transcript text e.g. "Hello, world!"
const segments = transcript.segments; // array of segments with start and end times, if available
const language = transcript.language; // language of the transcript e.g. "en", if available
const durationInSeconds = transcript.durationInSeconds; // duration of the transcript in seconds, if available
```

## Settings

### Provider-Specific settings

Transcription models often have provider or model-specific settings which you can set using the `providerOptions` parameter.

```ts highlight="8-12"
import { experimental_transcribe as transcribe } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';

const transcript = await transcribe({
  model: openai.transcription('whisper-1'),
  audio: await readFile('audio.mp3'),
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      timestampGranularities: ['word'],
    },
  },
});
```

### Abort Signals and Timeouts

`transcribe` accepts an optional `abortSignal` parameter of
type [`AbortSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal)
that you can use to abort the transcription process or set a timeout.

```ts highlight="8"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { experimental_transcribe as transcribe } from 'ai';
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';

const transcript = await transcribe({
  model: openai.transcription('whisper-1'),
  audio: await readFile('audio.mp3'),
  abortSignal: AbortSignal.timeout(1000), // Abort after 1 second
});
```

### Custom Headers

`transcribe` accepts an optional `headers` parameter of type `Record<string, string>`
that you can use to add custom headers to the transcription request.

```ts highlight="8"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { experimental_transcribe as transcribe } from 'ai';
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';

const transcript = await transcribe({
  model: openai.transcription('whisper-1'),
  audio: await readFile('audio.mp3'),
  headers: { 'X-Custom-Header': 'custom-value' },
});
```

### Warnings

Warnings (e.g. unsupported parameters) are available on the `warnings` property.

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { experimental_transcribe as transcribe } from 'ai';
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';

const transcript = await transcribe({
  model: openai.transcription('whisper-1'),
  audio: await readFile('audio.mp3'),
});

const warnings = transcript.warnings;
```

### Error Handling

When `transcribe` cannot generate a valid transcript, it throws a [`AI_NoTranscriptGeneratedError`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-errors/ai-no-transcript-generated-error).

This error can arise for any the following reasons:

- The model failed to generate a response
- The model generated a response that could not be parsed

The error preserves the following information to help you log the issue:

- `responses`: Metadata about the transcription model responses, including timestamp, model, and headers.
- `cause`: The cause of the error. You can use this for more detailed error handling.

```ts
import {
  experimental_transcribe as transcribe,
  NoTranscriptGeneratedError,
} from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';

try {
  await transcribe({
    model: openai.transcription('whisper-1'),
    audio: await readFile('audio.mp3'),
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (NoTranscriptGeneratedError.isInstance(error)) {
    console.log('NoTranscriptGeneratedError');
    console.log('Cause:', error.cause);
    console.log('Responses:', error.responses);
  }
}
```

# Speech

<Note type="warning">Speech is an experimental feature.</Note>

The AI SDK provides the [`generateSpeech`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-speech)
function to generate speech from text using a speech model.

```ts
import { experimental_generateSpeech as generateSpeech } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const audio = await generateSpeech({
  model: openai.speech('tts-1'),
  text: 'Hello, world!',
  voice: 'alloy',
});
```

### Language Setting

You can specify the language for speech generation (provider support varies):

```ts
import { experimental_generateSpeech as generateSpeech } from 'ai';
import { lmnt } from '@ai-sdk/lmnt';

const audio = await generateSpeech({
  model: lmnt.speech('aurora'),
  text: 'Hola, mundo!',
  language: 'es', // Spanish
});
```

To access the generated audio:

```ts
const audio = audio.audioData; // audio data e.g. Uint8Array
```

## Settings

### Provider-Specific settings

You can set model-specific settings with the `providerOptions` parameter.

```ts highlight="7-11"
import { experimental_generateSpeech as generateSpeech } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const audio = await generateSpeech({
  model: openai.speech('tts-1'),
  text: 'Hello, world!',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      // ...
    },
  },
});
```

### Abort Signals and Timeouts

`generateSpeech` accepts an optional `abortSignal` parameter of
type [`AbortSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal)
that you can use to abort the speech generation process or set a timeout.

```ts highlight="7"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { experimental_generateSpeech as generateSpeech } from 'ai';

const audio = await generateSpeech({
  model: openai.speech('tts-1'),
  text: 'Hello, world!',
  abortSignal: AbortSignal.timeout(1000), // Abort after 1 second
});
```

### Custom Headers

`generateSpeech` accepts an optional `headers` parameter of type `Record<string, string>`
that you can use to add custom headers to the speech generation request.

```ts highlight="7"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { experimental_generateSpeech as generateSpeech } from 'ai';

const audio = await generateSpeech({
  model: openai.speech('tts-1'),
  text: 'Hello, world!',
  headers: { 'X-Custom-Header': 'custom-value' },
});
```

### Warnings

Warnings (e.g. unsupported parameters) are available on the `warnings` property.

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { experimental_generateSpeech as generateSpeech } from 'ai';

const audio = await generateSpeech({
  model: openai.speech('tts-1'),
  text: 'Hello, world!',
});

const warnings = audio.warnings;
```

### Error Handling

When `generateSpeech` cannot generate a valid audio, it throws a [`AI_NoSpeechGeneratedError`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-errors/ai-no-speech-generated-error).

This error can arise for any the following reasons:

- The model failed to generate a response
- The model generated a response that could not be parsed

The error preserves the following information to help you log the issue:

- `responses`: Metadata about the speech model responses, including timestamp, model, and headers.
- `cause`: The cause of the error. You can use this for more detailed error handling.

```ts
import {
  experimental_generateSpeech as generateSpeech,
  NoSpeechGeneratedError,
} from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

try {
  await generateSpeech({
    model: openai.speech('tts-1'),
    text: 'Hello, world!',
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (NoSpeechGeneratedError.isInstance(error)) {
    console.log('AI_NoSpeechGeneratedError');
    console.log('Cause:', error.cause);
    console.log('Responses:', error.responses);
  }
}
```

title: Language Model Middleware
description: Learn how to use middleware to enhance the behavior of language models

---

# Language Model Middleware

Language model middleware is a way to enhance the behavior of language models
by intercepting and modifying the calls to the language model.

It can be used to add features like guardrails, RAG, caching, and logging
in a language model agnostic way. Such middleware can be developed and
distributed independently from the language models that they are applied to.

## Using Language Model Middleware

You can use language model middleware with the `wrapLanguageModel` function.
It takes a language model and a language model middleware and returns a new
language model that incorporates the middleware.

```ts
import { wrapLanguageModel } from 'ai';

const wrappedLanguageModel = wrapLanguageModel({
  model: yourModel,
  middleware: yourLanguageModelMiddleware,
});
```

The wrapped language model can be used just like any other language model, e.g. in `streamText`:

```ts highlight="2"
const result = streamText({
  model: wrappedLanguageModel,
  prompt: 'What cities are in the United States?',
});
```

## Multiple middlewares

You can provide multiple middlewares to the `wrapLanguageModel` function.
The middlewares will be applied in the order they are provided.

```ts
const wrappedLanguageModel = wrapLanguageModel({
  model: yourModel,
  middleware: [firstMiddleware, secondMiddleware],
});

// applied as: firstMiddleware(secondMiddleware(yourModel))
```

## Built-in Middleware

The AI SDK comes with several built-in middlewares that you can use to configure language models:

- `extractReasoningMiddleware`: Extracts reasoning information from the generated text and exposes it as a `reasoning` property on the result.
- `simulateStreamingMiddleware`: Simulates streaming behavior with responses from non-streaming language models.
- `defaultSettingsMiddleware`: Applies default settings to a language model.

### Extract Reasoning

Some providers and models expose reasoning information in the generated text using special tags,
e.g. &lt;think&gt; and &lt;/think&gt;.

The `extractReasoningMiddleware` function can be used to extract this reasoning information and expose it as a `reasoning` property on the result.

```ts
import { wrapLanguageModel, extractReasoningMiddleware } from 'ai';

const model = wrapLanguageModel({
  model: yourModel,
  middleware: extractReasoningMiddleware({ tagName: 'think' }),
});
```

You can then use that enhanced model in functions like `generateText` and `streamText`.

The `extractReasoningMiddleware` function also includes a `startWithReasoning` option.
When set to `true`, the reasoning tag will be prepended to the generated text.
This is useful for models that do not include the reasoning tag at the beginning of the response.
For more details, see the [DeepSeek R1 guide](/docs/guides/r1#deepseek-r1-middleware).

### Simulate Streaming

The `simulateStreamingMiddleware` function can be used to simulate streaming behavior with responses from non-streaming language models.
This is useful when you want to maintain a consistent streaming interface even when using models that only provide complete responses.

```ts
import { wrapLanguageModel, simulateStreamingMiddleware } from 'ai';

const model = wrapLanguageModel({
  model: yourModel,
  middleware: simulateStreamingMiddleware(),
});
```

### Default Settings

The `defaultSettingsMiddleware` function can be used to apply default settings to a language model.

```ts
import { wrapLanguageModel, defaultSettingsMiddleware } from 'ai';

const model = wrapLanguageModel({
  model: yourModel,
  middleware: defaultSettingsMiddleware({
    settings: {
      temperature: 0.5,
      maxOutputTokens: 800,
      providerOptions: { openai: { store: false } },
    },
  }),
});
```

## Community Middleware

The AI SDK provides a Language Model Middleware specification. Community members can develop middleware that adheres to this specification, making it compatible with the AI SDK ecosystem.

Here are some community middlewares that you can explore:

### Custom tool call parser

The [Custom tool call parser](https://github.com/minpeter/ai-sdk-tool-call-middleware) middleware extends tool call capabilities to models that don't natively support the OpenAI-style `tools` parameter. This includes many self-hosted and third-party models that lack native function calling features.

<Note>
  Using this middleware on models that support native function calls may result
  in unintended performance degradation, so check whether your model supports
  native function calls before deciding to use it.
</Note>

This middleware enables function calling capabilities by converting function schemas into prompt instructions and parsing the model's responses into structured function calls. It works by transforming the JSON function definitions into natural language instructions the model can understand, then analyzing the generated text to extract function call attempts. This approach allows developers to use the same function calling API across different model providers, even with models that don't natively support the OpenAI-style function calling format, providing a consistent function calling experience regardless of the underlying model implementation.

The `@ai-sdk-tool/parser` package offers three middleware variants:

- `createToolMiddleware`: A flexible function for creating custom tool call middleware tailored to specific models
- `hermesToolMiddleware`: Ready-to-use middleware for Hermes & Qwen format function calls
- `gemmaToolMiddleware`: Pre-configured middleware for Gemma 3 model series function call format

Here's how you can enable function calls with Gemma models that don't support them natively:

```ts
import { wrapLanguageModel } from 'ai';
import { gemmaToolMiddleware } from '@ai-sdk-tool/parser';

const model = wrapLanguageModel({
  model: openrouter('google/gemma-3-27b-it'),
  middleware: gemmaToolMiddleware,
});
```

Find more examples at this [link](https://github.com/minpeter/ai-sdk-tool-call-middleware/tree/main/examples/core/src).

## Implementing Language Model Middleware

<Note>
  Implementing language model middleware is advanced functionality and requires
  a solid understanding of the [language model
  specification](https://github.com/vercel/ai/blob/v5/packages/provider/src/language-model/v2/language-model-v2.ts).
</Note>

You can implement any of the following three function to modify the behavior of the language model:

1. `transformParams`: Transforms the parameters before they are passed to the language model, for both `doGenerate` and `doStream`.
2. `wrapGenerate`: Wraps the `doGenerate` method of the [language model](https://github.com/vercel/ai/blob/v5/packages/provider/src/language-model/v2/language-model-v2.ts).
   You can modify the parameters, call the language model, and modify the result.
3. `wrapStream`: Wraps the `doStream` method of the [language model](https://github.com/vercel/ai/blob/v5/packages/provider/src/language-model/v2/language-model-v2.ts).
   You can modify the parameters, call the language model, and modify the result.

Here are some examples of how to implement language model middleware:

## Examples

<Note>
  These examples are not meant to be used in production. They are just to show
  how you can use middleware to enhance the behavior of language models.
</Note>

### Logging

This example shows how to log the parameters and generated text of a language model call.

```ts
import type {
  LanguageModelV3Middleware,
  LanguageModelV3StreamPart,
} from '@ai-sdk/provider';

export const yourLogMiddleware: LanguageModelV3Middleware = {
  wrapGenerate: async ({ doGenerate, params }) => {
    console.log('doGenerate called');
    console.log(`params: ${JSON.stringify(params, null, 2)}`);

    const result = await doGenerate();

    console.log('doGenerate finished');
    console.log(`generated text: ${result.text}`);

    return result;
  },

  wrapStream: async ({ doStream, params }) => {
    console.log('doStream called');
    console.log(`params: ${JSON.stringify(params, null, 2)}`);

    const { stream, ...rest } = await doStream();

    let generatedText = '';
    const textBlocks = new Map<string, string>();

    const transformStream = new TransformStream<
      LanguageModelV3StreamPart,
      LanguageModelV3StreamPart
    >({
      transform(chunk, controller) {
        switch (chunk.type) {
          case 'text-start': {
            textBlocks.set(chunk.id, '');
            break;
          }
          case 'text-delta': {
            const existing = textBlocks.get(chunk.id) || '';
            textBlocks.set(chunk.id, existing + chunk.delta);
            generatedText += chunk.delta;
            break;
          }
          case 'text-end': {
            console.log(
              `Text block ${chunk.id} completed:`,
              textBlocks.get(chunk.id)
            );
            break;
          }
        }

        controller.enqueue(chunk);
      },

      flush() {
        console.log('doStream finished');
        console.log(`generated text: ${generatedText}`);
      },
    });

    return {
      stream: stream.pipeThrough(transformStream),
      ...rest,
    };
  },
};
```

### Caching

This example shows how to build a simple cache for the generated text of a language model call.

```ts
import type { LanguageModelV3Middleware } from '@ai-sdk/provider';

const cache = new Map<string, any>();

export const yourCacheMiddleware: LanguageModelV3Middleware = {
  wrapGenerate: async ({ doGenerate, params }) => {
    const cacheKey = JSON.stringify(params);

    if (cache.has(cacheKey)) {
      return cache.get(cacheKey);
    }

    const result = await doGenerate();

    cache.set(cacheKey, result);

    return result;
  },

  // here you would implement the caching logic for streaming
};
```

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

This example shows how to use RAG as middleware.

<Note>
  Helper functions like `getLastUserMessageText` and `findSources` are not part
  of the AI SDK. They are just used in this example to illustrate the concept of
  RAG.
</Note>

```ts
import type { LanguageModelV3Middleware } from '@ai-sdk/provider';

export const yourRagMiddleware: LanguageModelV3Middleware = {
  transformParams: async ({ params }) => {
    const lastUserMessageText = getLastUserMessageText({
      prompt: params.prompt,
    });

    if (lastUserMessageText == null) {
      return params; // do not use RAG (send unmodified parameters)
    }

    const instruction =
      'Use the following information to answer the question:\n' +
      findSources({ text: lastUserMessageText })
        .map((chunk) => JSON.stringify(chunk))
        .join('\n');

    return addToLastUserMessage({ params, text: instruction });
  },
};
```

### Guardrails

Guard rails are a way to ensure that the generated text of a language model call
is safe and appropriate. This example shows how to use guardrails as middleware.

```ts
import type { LanguageModelV3Middleware } from '@ai-sdk/provider';

export const yourGuardrailMiddleware: LanguageModelV3Middleware = {
  wrapGenerate: async ({ doGenerate }) => {
    const { text, ...rest } = await doGenerate();

    // filtering approach, e.g. for PII or other sensitive information:
    const cleanedText = text?.replace(/badword/g, '<REDACTED>');

    return { text: cleanedText, ...rest };
  },

  // here you would implement the guardrail logic for streaming
  // Note: streaming guardrails are difficult to implement, because
  // you do not know the full content of the stream until it's finished.
};
```

## Configuring Per Request Custom Metadata

To send and access custom metadata in Middleware, you can use `providerOptions`. This is useful when building logging middleware where you want to pass additional context like user IDs, timestamps, or other contextual data that can help with tracking and debugging.

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText, wrapLanguageModel } from 'ai';
import type { LanguageModelV3Middleware } from '@ai-sdk/provider';

export const yourLogMiddleware: LanguageModelV3Middleware = {
  wrapGenerate: async ({ doGenerate, params }) => {
    console.log('METADATA', params?.providerMetadata?.yourLogMiddleware);
    const result = await doGenerate();
    return result;
  },
};

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: wrapLanguageModel({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    middleware: yourLogMiddleware,
  }),
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
  providerOptions: {
    yourLogMiddleware: {
      hello: 'world',
    },
  },
});

console.log(text);
```

title: Provider & Model Management
description: Learn how to work with multiple providers and models

# Provider & Model Management

When you work with multiple providers and models, it is often desirable to manage them in a central place
and access the models through simple string ids.

The AI SDK offers [custom providers](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/custom-provider) and
a [provider registry](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/provider-registry) for this purpose:

- With **custom providers**, you can pre-configure model settings, provide model name aliases,
  and limit the available models.
- The **provider registry** lets you mix multiple providers and access them through simple string ids.

You can mix and match custom providers, the provider registry, and [middleware](/docs/ai-sdk-core/middleware) in your application.

## Custom Providers

You can create a [custom provider](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/custom-provider) using `customProvider`.

### Example: custom model settings

You might want to override the default model settings for a provider or provide model name aliases
with pre-configured settings.

```ts
import {
  gateway,
  customProvider,
  defaultSettingsMiddleware,
  wrapLanguageModel,
} from 'ai';

// custom provider with different provider options:
export const openai = customProvider({
  languageModels: {
    // replacement model with custom provider options:
    'gpt-5.1': wrapLanguageModel({
      model: gateway('openai/gpt-5.1'),
      middleware: defaultSettingsMiddleware({
        settings: {
          providerOptions: {
            openai: {
              reasoningEffort: 'high',
            },
          },
        },
      }),
    }),
    // alias model with custom provider options:
    'gpt-5.1-high-reasoning': wrapLanguageModel({
      model: gateway('openai/gpt-5.1'),
      middleware: defaultSettingsMiddleware({
        settings: {
          providerOptions: {
            openai: {
              reasoningEffort: 'high',
            },
          },
        },
      }),
    }),
  },
  fallbackProvider: gateway,
});
```

### Example: model name alias

You can also provide model name aliases, so you can update the model version in one place in the future:

```ts
import { customProvider, gateway } from 'ai';

// custom provider with alias names:
export const anthropic = customProvider({
  languageModels: {
    opus: gateway('anthropic/claude-opus-4.1'),
    sonnet: gateway('anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5'),
    haiku: gateway('anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5'),
  },
  fallbackProvider: gateway,
});
```

### Example: limit available models

You can limit the available models in the system, even if you have multiple providers.

```ts
import {
  customProvider,
  defaultSettingsMiddleware,
  wrapLanguageModel,
  gateway,
} from 'ai';

export const myProvider = customProvider({
  languageModels: {
    'text-medium': gateway('anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620'),
    'text-small': gateway('openai/gpt-5-mini'),
    'reasoning-medium': wrapLanguageModel({
      model: gateway('openai/gpt-5.1'),
      middleware: defaultSettingsMiddleware({
        settings: {
          providerOptions: {
            openai: {
              reasoningEffort: 'high',
            },
          },
        },
      }),
    }),
    'reasoning-fast': wrapLanguageModel({
      model: gateway('openai/gpt-5.1'),
      middleware: defaultSettingsMiddleware({
        settings: {
          providerOptions: {
            openai: {
              reasoningEffort: 'low',
            },
          },
        },
      }),
    }),
  },
  embeddingModels: {
    embedding: gateway.textEmbeddingModel('openai/text-embedding-3-small'),
  },
  // no fallback provider
});
```

## Provider Registry

You can create a [provider registry](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/provider-registry) with multiple providers and models using `createProviderRegistry`.

### Setup

```ts filename={"registry.ts"}
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { createProviderRegistry, gateway } from 'ai';

export const registry = createProviderRegistry({
  // register provider with prefix and default setup using gateway:
  gateway,

  // register provider with prefix and direct provider import:
  anthropic,
  openai,
});
```

### Setup with Custom Separator

By default, the registry uses `:` as the separator between provider and model IDs. You can customize this separator:

```ts filename={"registry.ts"}
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { createProviderRegistry, gateway } from 'ai';

export const customSeparatorRegistry = createProviderRegistry(
  {
    gateway,
    anthropic,
    openai,
  },
  { separator: ' > ' }
);
```

### Example: Use language models

You can access language models by using the `languageModel` method on the registry.
The provider id will become the prefix of the model id: `providerId:modelId`.

```ts highlight={"5"}
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { registry } from './registry';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: registry.languageModel('openai:gpt-5.1'), // default separator
  // or with custom separator:
  // model: customSeparatorRegistry.languageModel('openai > gpt-5.1'),
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
});
```

### Example: Use text embedding models

You can access text embedding models by using the `textEmbeddingModel` method on the registry.
The provider id will become the prefix of the model id: `providerId:modelId`.

```ts highlight={"5"}
import { embed } from 'ai';
import { registry } from './registry';

const { embedding } = await embed({
  model: registry.textEmbeddingModel('openai:text-embedding-3-small'),
  value: 'sunny day at the beach',
});
```

### Example: Use image models

You can access image models by using the `imageModel` method on the registry.
The provider id will become the prefix of the model id: `providerId:modelId`.

```ts highlight={"5"}
import { generateImage } from 'ai';
import { registry } from './registry';

const { image } = await generateImage({
  model: registry.imageModel('openai:dall-e-3'),
  prompt: 'A beautiful sunset over a calm ocean',
});
```

## Combining Custom Providers, Provider Registry, and Middleware

The central idea of provider management is to set up a file that contains all the providers and models you want to use.
You may want to pre-configure model settings, provide model name aliases, limit the available models, and more.

Here is an example that implements the following concepts:

- pass through gateway with a namespace prefix (here: `gateway > *`)
- pass through a full provider with a namespace prefix (here: `xai > *`)
- setup an OpenAI-compatible provider with custom api key and base URL (here: `custom > *`)
- setup model name aliases (here: `anthropic > fast`, `anthropic > writing`, `anthropic > reasoning`)
- pre-configure model settings (here: `anthropic > reasoning`)
- validate the provider-specific options (here: `AnthropicProviderOptions`)
- use a fallback provider (here: `anthropic > *`)
- limit a provider to certain models without a fallback (here: `groq > gemma2-9b-it`, `groq > qwen-qwq-32b`)
- define a custom separator for the provider registry (here: `>`)

```ts
import { anthropic, AnthropicProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { createOpenAICompatible } from '@ai-sdk/openai-compatible';
import { xai } from '@ai-sdk/xai';
import { groq } from '@ai-sdk/groq';
import {
  createProviderRegistry,
  customProvider,
  defaultSettingsMiddleware,
  gateway,
  wrapLanguageModel,
} from 'ai';

export const registry = createProviderRegistry(
  {
    // pass through gateway with a namespace prefix
    gateway,

    // pass through full providers with namespace prefixes
    xai,

    // access an OpenAI-compatible provider with custom setup
    custom: createOpenAICompatible({
      name: 'provider-name',
      apiKey: process.env.CUSTOM_API_KEY,
      baseURL: 'https://api.custom.com/v1',
    }),

    // setup model name aliases
    anthropic: customProvider({
      languageModels: {
        fast: anthropic('claude-haiku-4-5'),

        // simple model
        writing: anthropic('claude-sonnet-4-5'),

        // extended reasoning model configuration:
        reasoning: wrapLanguageModel({
          model: anthropic('claude-sonnet-4-5'),
          middleware: defaultSettingsMiddleware({
            settings: {
              maxOutputTokens: 100000, // example default setting
              providerOptions: {
                anthropic: {
                  thinking: {
                    type: 'enabled',
                    budgetTokens: 32000,
                  },
                } satisfies AnthropicProviderOptions,
              },
            },
          }),
        }),
      },
      fallbackProvider: anthropic,
    }),

    // limit a provider to certain models without a fallback
    groq: customProvider({
      languageModels: {
        'gemma2-9b-it': groq('gemma2-9b-it'),
        'qwen-qwq-32b': groq('qwen-qwq-32b'),
      },
    }),
  },
  { separator: ' > ' }
);

// usage:
const model = registry.languageModel('anthropic > reasoning');
```

## Global Provider Configuration

The AI SDK 5 includes a global provider feature that allows you to specify a model using just a plain model ID string:

```ts
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = await streamText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5', // Uses the global provider (defaults to gateway)
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
});
```

By default, the global provider is set to the Vercel AI Gateway.

### Customizing the Global Provider

You can set your own preferred global provider:

```ts filename="setup.ts"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

// Initialize once during startup:
globalThis.AI_SDK_DEFAULT_PROVIDER = openai;
```

```ts filename="app.ts"
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = await streamText({
  model: 'gpt-5.1', // Uses OpenAI provider without prefix
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
});
```

This simplifies provider usage and makes it easier to switch between providers without changing your model references throughout your codebase.

title: Error Handling
description: Learn how to handle errors in the AI SDK Core

---

# Error Handling

## Handling regular errors

Regular errors are thrown and can be handled using the `try/catch` block.

```ts highlight="3,8-10"
import { generateText } from 'ai';

try {
  const { text } = await generateText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
  });
} catch (error) {
  // handle error
}
```

See [Error Types](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-errors) for more information on the different types of errors that may be thrown.

## Handling streaming errors (simple streams)

When errors occur during streams that do not support error chunks,
the error is thrown as a regular error.
You can handle these errors using the `try/catch` block.

```ts highlight="3,12-14"
import { streamText } from 'ai';

try {
  const { textStream } = streamText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
  });

  for await (const textPart of textStream) {
    process.stdout.write(textPart);
  }
} catch (error) {
  // handle error
}
```

## Handling streaming errors (streaming with `error` support)

Full streams support error parts.
You can handle those parts similar to other parts.
It is recommended to also add a try-catch block for errors that
happen outside of the streaming.

```ts highlight="13-21"
import { streamText } from 'ai';

try {
  const { fullStream } = streamText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
  });

  for await (const part of fullStream) {
    switch (part.type) {
      // ... handle other part types

      case 'error': {
        const error = part.error;
        // handle error
        break;
      }

      case 'abort': {
        // handle stream abort
        break;
      }

      case 'tool-error': {
        const error = part.error;
        // handle error
        break;
      }
    }
  }
} catch (error) {
  // handle error
}
```

## Handling stream aborts

When streams are aborted (e.g., via chat stop button), you may want to perform cleanup operations like updating stored messages in your UI. Use the `onAbort` callback to handle these cases.

The `onAbort` callback is called when a stream is aborted via `AbortSignal`, but `onFinish` is not called. This ensures you can still update your UI state appropriately.

```ts highlight="5-9"
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const { textStream } = streamText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
  onAbort: ({ steps }) => {
    // Update stored messages or perform cleanup
    console.log('Stream aborted after', steps.length, 'steps');
  },
  onFinish: ({ steps, totalUsage }) => {
    // This is called on normal completion
    console.log('Stream completed normally');
  },
});

for await (const textPart of textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(textPart);
}
```

The `onAbort` callback receives:

- `steps`: An array of all completed steps before the abort

You can also handle abort events directly in the stream:

```ts highlight="10-13"
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const { fullStream } = streamText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});

for await (const chunk of fullStream) {
  switch (chunk.type) {
    case 'abort': {
      // Handle abort directly in stream
      console.log('Stream was aborted');
      break;
    }
    // ... handle other part types
  }
}
```

title: Testing
description: Learn how to use AI SDK Core mock providers for testing.

---

# Testing

Testing language models can be challenging, because they are non-deterministic
and calling them is slow and expensive.

To enable you to unit test your code that uses the AI SDK, the AI SDK Core
includes mock providers and test helpers. You can import the following helpers from `ai/test`:

- `MockEmbeddingModelV3`: A mock embedding model using the [embedding model v3 specification](https://github.com/vercel/ai/blob/v5/packages/provider/src/embedding-model/v3/embedding-model-v3.ts).
- `MockLanguageModelV3`: A mock language model using the [language model v3 specification](https://github.com/vercel/ai/blob/v5/packages/provider/src/language-model/v3/language-model-v3.ts).
- `mockId`: Provides an incrementing integer ID.
- `mockValues`: Iterates over an array of values with each call. Returns the last value when the array is exhausted.
- [`simulateReadableStream`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/simulate-readable-stream): Simulates a readable stream with delays.

With mock providers and test helpers, you can control the output of the AI SDK
and test your code in a repeatable and deterministic way without actually calling
a language model provider.

## Examples

You can use the test helpers with the AI Core functions in your unit tests:

### generateText

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { MockLanguageModelV3 } from 'ai/test';

const result = await generateText({
  model: new MockLanguageModelV3({
    doGenerate: async () => ({
      finishReason: 'stop',
      usage: { inputTokens: 10, outputTokens: 20, totalTokens: 30 },
      content: [{ type: 'text', text: `Hello, world!` }],
      warnings: [],
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Hello, test!',
});
```

### streamText

```ts
import { streamText, simulateReadableStream } from 'ai';
import { MockLanguageModelV3 } from 'ai/test';

const result = streamText({
  model: new MockLanguageModelV3({
    doStream: async () => ({
      stream: simulateReadableStream({
        chunks: [
          { type: 'text-start', id: 'text-1' },
          { type: 'text-delta', id: 'text-1', delta: 'Hello' },
          { type: 'text-delta', id: 'text-1', delta: ', ' },
          { type: 'text-delta', id: 'text-1', delta: 'world!' },
          { type: 'text-end', id: 'text-1' },
          {
            type: 'finish',
            finishReason: 'stop',
            logprobs: undefined,
            usage: { inputTokens: 3, outputTokens: 10, totalTokens: 13 },
          },
        ],
      }),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Hello, test!',
});
```

### generateObject

```ts
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { MockLanguageModelV3 } from 'ai/test';
import { z } from 'zod';

const result = await generateObject({
  model: new MockLanguageModelV3({
    doGenerate: async () => ({
      finishReason: 'stop',
      usage: { inputTokens: 10, outputTokens: 20, totalTokens: 30 },
      content: [{ type: 'text', text: `{"content":"Hello, world!"}` }],
      warnings: [],
    }),
  }),
  schema: z.object({ content: z.string() }),
  prompt: 'Hello, test!',
});
```

### streamObject

```ts
import { streamObject, simulateReadableStream } from 'ai';
import { MockLanguageModelV3 } from 'ai/test';
import { z } from 'zod';

const result = streamObject({
  model: new MockLanguageModelV3({
    doStream: async () => ({
      stream: simulateReadableStream({
        chunks: [
          { type: 'text-start', id: 'text-1' },
          { type: 'text-delta', id: 'text-1', delta: '{ ' },
          { type: 'text-delta', id: 'text-1', delta: '"content": ' },
          { type: 'text-delta', id: 'text-1', delta: `"Hello, ` },
          { type: 'text-delta', id: 'text-1', delta: `world` },
          { type: 'text-delta', id: 'text-1', delta: `!"` },
          { type: 'text-delta', id: 'text-1', delta: ' }' },
          { type: 'text-end', id: 'text-1' },
          {
            type: 'finish',
            finishReason: 'stop',
            logprobs: undefined,
            usage: { inputTokens: 3, outputTokens: 10, totalTokens: 13 },
          },
        ],
      }),
    }),
  }),
  schema: z.object({ content: z.string() }),
  prompt: 'Hello, test!',
});
```

### Simulate UI Message Stream Responses

You can also simulate [UI Message Stream](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/stream-protocol#ui-message-stream) responses for testing,
debugging, or demonstration purposes.

Here is a Next example:

```ts filename="route.ts"
import { simulateReadableStream } from 'ai';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  return new Response(
    simulateReadableStream({
      initialDelayInMs: 1000, // Delay before the first chunk
      chunkDelayInMs: 300, // Delay between chunks
      chunks: [
        `data: {"type":"start","messageId":"msg-123"}\n\n`,
        `data: {"type":"text-start","id":"text-1"}\n\n`,
        `data: {"type":"text-delta","id":"text-1","delta":"This"}\n\n`,
        `data: {"type":"text-delta","id":"text-1","delta":" is an"}\n\n`,
        `data: {"type":"text-delta","id":"text-1","delta":" example."}\n\n`,
        `data: {"type":"text-end","id":"text-1"}\n\n`,
        `data: {"type":"finish"}\n\n`,
        `data: [DONE]\n\n`,
      ],
    }).pipeThrough(new TextEncoderStream()),
    {
      status: 200,
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
        'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
        Connection: 'keep-alive',
        'x-vercel-ai-ui-message-stream': 'v1',
      },
    }
  );
}
```

title: Telemetry
description: Using OpenTelemetry with AI SDK Core

---

# Telemetry

<Note type="warning">
  AI SDK Telemetry is experimental and may change in the future.
</Note>

The AI SDK uses [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) to collect telemetry data.
OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework designed to provide
standardized instrumentation for collecting telemetry data.

Check out the [AI SDK Observability Integrations](/providers/observability)
to see providers that offer monitoring and tracing for AI SDK applications.

## Enabling telemetry

For Next.js applications, please follow the [Next.js OpenTelemetry guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/open-telemetry) to enable telemetry first.

You can then use the `experimental_telemetry` option to enable telemetry on specific function calls while the feature is experimental:

```ts highlight="4"
const result = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  prompt: 'Write a short story about a cat.',
  experimental_telemetry: { isEnabled: true },
});
```

When telemetry is enabled, you can also control if you want to record the input values and the output values for the function.
By default, both are enabled. You can disable them by setting the `recordInputs` and `recordOutputs` options to `false`.

Disabling the recording of inputs and outputs can be useful for privacy, data transfer, and performance reasons.
You might for example want to disable recording inputs if they contain sensitive information.

## Telemetry Metadata

You can provide a `functionId` to identify the function that the telemetry data is for,
and `metadata` to include additional information in the telemetry data.

```ts highlight="6-10"
const result = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  prompt: 'Write a short story about a cat.',
  experimental_telemetry: {
    isEnabled: true,
    functionId: 'my-awesome-function',
    metadata: {
      something: 'custom',
      someOtherThing: 'other-value',
    },
  },
});
```

## Custom Tracer

You may provide a `tracer` which must return an OpenTelemetry `Tracer`. This is useful in situations where
you want your traces to use a `TracerProvider` other than the one provided by the `@opentelemetry/api` singleton.

```ts highlight="7"
const tracerProvider = new NodeTracerProvider();
const result = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  prompt: 'Write a short story about a cat.',
  experimental_telemetry: {
    isEnabled: true,
    tracer: tracerProvider.getTracer('ai'),
  },
});
```

## Collected Data

### generateText function

`generateText` records 3 types of spans:

- `ai.generateText` (span): the full length of the generateText call. It contains 1 or more `ai.generateText.doGenerate` spans.
  It contains the [basic LLM span information](#basic-llm-span-information) and the following attributes:

  - `operation.name`: `ai.generateText` and the functionId that was set through `telemetry.functionId`
  - `ai.operationId`: `"ai.generateText"`
  - `ai.prompt`: the prompt that was used when calling `generateText`
  - `ai.response.text`: the text that was generated
  - `ai.response.toolCalls`: the tool calls that were made as part of the generation (stringified JSON)
  - `ai.response.finishReason`: the reason why the generation finished
  - `ai.settings.maxOutputTokens`: the maximum number of output tokens that were set

- `ai.generateText.doGenerate` (span): a provider doGenerate call. It can contain `ai.toolCall` spans.
  It contains the [call LLM span information](#call-llm-span-information) and the following attributes:

  - `operation.name`: `ai.generateText.doGenerate` and the functionId that was set through `telemetry.functionId`
  - `ai.operationId`: `"ai.generateText.doGenerate"`
  - `ai.prompt.messages`: the messages that were passed into the provider
  - `ai.prompt.tools`: array of stringified tool definitions. The tools can be of type `function` or `provider-defined-client`.
    Function tools have a `name`, `description` (optional), and `inputSchema` (JSON schema).
    Provider-defined-client tools have a `name`, `id`, and `input` (Record).
  - `ai.prompt.toolChoice`: the stringified tool choice setting (JSON). It has a `type` property
    (`auto`, `none`, `required`, `tool`), and if the type is `tool`, a `toolName` property with the specific tool.
  - `ai.response.text`: the text that was generated
  - `ai.response.toolCalls`: the tool calls that were made as part of the generation (stringified JSON)
  - `ai.response.finishReason`: the reason why the generation finished

- `ai.toolCall` (span): a tool call that is made as part of the generateText call. See [Tool call spans](#tool-call-spans) for more details.

### streamText function

`streamText` records 3 types of spans and 2 types of events:

- `ai.streamText` (span): the full length of the streamText call. It contains a `ai.streamText.doStream` span.
  It contains the [basic LLM span information](#basic-llm-span-information) and the following attributes:

  - `operation.name`: `ai.streamText` and the functionId that was set through `telemetry.functionId`

# AI SDK UI

AI SDK UI is designed to help you build interactive chat, completion, and assistant applications with ease. It is a **framework-agnostic toolkit**, streamlining the integration of advanced AI functionalities into your applications.

AI SDK UI provides robust abstractions that simplify the complex tasks of managing chat streams and UI updates on the frontend, enabling you to develop dynamic AI-driven interfaces more efficiently. With three main hooks — **`useChat`**, **`useCompletion`**, and **`useObject`** — you can incorporate real-time chat capabilities, text completions, streamed JSON, and interactive assistant features into your app.

- **[`useChat`](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot)** offers real-time streaming of chat messages, abstracting state management for inputs, messages, loading, and errors, allowing for seamless integration into any UI design.
- **[`useCompletion`](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/completion)** enables you to handle text completions in your applications, managing the prompt input and automatically updating the UI as new completions are streamed.
- **[`useObject`](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/object-generation)** is a hook that allows you to consume streamed JSON objects, providing a simple way to handle and display structured data in your application.

These hooks are designed to reduce the complexity and time required to implement AI interactions, letting you focus on creating exceptional user experiences.

## UI Framework Support

AI SDK UI supports the following frameworks: [React](https://react.dev/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), and [Angular](https://angular.dev/).

# Chatbot

The `useChat` hook makes it effortless to create a conversational user interface for your chatbot application. It enables the streaming of chat messages from your AI provider, manages the chat state, and updates the UI automatically as new messages arrive.

To summarize, the `useChat` hook provides the following features:

- **Message Streaming**: All the messages from the AI provider are streamed to the chat UI in real-time.
- **Managed States**: The hook manages the states for input, messages, status, error and more for you.
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrate your chat AI into any design or layout with minimal effort.

In this guide, you will learn how to use the `useChat` hook to create a chatbot application with real-time message streaming.
Check out our [chatbot with tools guide](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot-with-tool-calling) to learn how to use tools in your chatbot.
Let's start with the following example first.

## Example

```tsx filename='app/page.tsx'
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { DefaultChatTransport } from 'ai';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Page() {
  const { messages, sendMessage, status } = useChat({
    transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
      api: '/api/chat',
    }),
  });
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');

  return (
    <>
      {messages.map((message) => (
        <div key={message.id}>
          {message.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
          {message.parts.map((part, index) =>
            part.type === 'text' ? <span key={index}>{part.text}</span> : null
          )}
        </div>
      ))}

      <form
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          if (input.trim()) {
            sendMessage({ text: input });
            setInput('');
          }
        }}
      >
        <input
          value={input}
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
          disabled={status !== 'ready'}
          placeholder="Say something..."
        />
        <button type="submit" disabled={status !== 'ready'}>
          Submit
        </button>
      </form>
    </>
  );
}
```

```ts filename='app/api/chat/route.ts'
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { convertToModelMessages, streamText, UIMessage } from 'ai';

// Allow streaming responses up to 30 seconds
export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    system: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

<Note>
  The UI messages have a new `parts` property that contains the message parts.
  We recommend rendering the messages using the `parts` property instead of the
  `content` property. The parts property supports different message types,
  including text, tool invocation, and tool result, and allows for more flexible
  and complex chat UIs.
</Note>

In the `Page` component, the `useChat` hook will request to your AI provider endpoint whenever the user sends a message using `sendMessage`.
The messages are then streamed back in real-time and displayed in the chat UI.

This enables a seamless chat experience where the user can see the AI response as soon as it is available,
without having to wait for the entire response to be received.

## Customized UI

`useChat` also provides ways to manage the chat message states via code, show status, and update messages without being triggered by user interactions.

### Status

The `useChat` hook returns a `status`. It has the following possible values:

- `submitted`: The message has been sent to the API and we're awaiting the start of the response stream.
- `streaming`: The response is actively streaming in from the API, receiving chunks of data.
- `ready`: The full response has been received and processed; a new user message can be submitted.
- `error`: An error occurred during the API request, preventing successful completion.

You can use `status` for e.g. the following purposes:

- To show a loading spinner while the chatbot is processing the user's message.
- To show a "Stop" button to abort the current message.
- To disable the submit button.

```tsx filename='app/page.tsx' highlight="6,22-29,36"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { DefaultChatTransport } from 'ai';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Page() {
  const { messages, sendMessage, status, stop } = useChat({
    transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
      api: '/api/chat',
    }),
  });
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');

  return (
    <>
      {messages.map((message) => (
        <div key={message.id}>
          {message.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
          {message.parts.map((part, index) =>
            part.type === 'text' ? <span key={index}>{part.text}</span> : null
          )}
        </div>
      ))}

      {(status === 'submitted' || status === 'streaming') && (
        <div>
          {status === 'submitted' && <Spinner />}
          <button type="button" onClick={() => stop()}>
            Stop
          </button>
        </div>
      )}

      <form
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          if (input.trim()) {
            sendMessage({ text: input });
            setInput('');
          }
        }}
      >
        <input
          value={input}
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
          disabled={status !== 'ready'}
          placeholder="Say something..."
        />
        <button type="submit" disabled={status !== 'ready'}>
          Submit
        </button>
      </form>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Error State

Similarly, the `error` state reflects the error object thrown during the fetch request.
It can be used to display an error message, disable the submit button, or show a retry button:

<Note>
  We recommend showing a generic error message to the user, such as "Something
  went wrong." This is a good practice to avoid leaking information from the
  server.
</Note>

```tsx file="app/page.tsx" highlight="6,20-27,33"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { DefaultChatTransport } from 'ai';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages, sendMessage, error, reload } = useChat({
    transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
      api: '/api/chat',
    }),
  });
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');

  return (
    <div>
      {messages.map((m) => (
        <div key={m.id}>
          {m.role}:{' '}
          {m.parts.map((part, index) =>
            part.type === 'text' ? <span key={index}>{part.text}</span> : null
          )}
        </div>
      ))}

      {error && (
        <>
          <div>An error occurred.</div>
          <button type="button" onClick={() => reload()}>
            Retry
          </button>
        </>
      )}

      <form
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          if (input.trim()) {
            sendMessage({ text: input });
            setInput('');
          }
        }}
      >
        <input
          value={input}
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
          disabled={error != null}
        />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Please also see the [error handling](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/error-handling) guide for more information.

### Modify messages

Sometimes, you may want to directly modify some existing messages. For example, a delete button can be added to each message to allow users to remove them from the chat history.

The `setMessages` function can help you achieve these tasks:

```tsx
const { messages, setMessages } = useChat()

const handleDelete = (id) => {
  setMessages(messages.filter(message => message.id !== id))
}

return <>
  {messages.map(message => (
    <div key={message.id}>
      {message.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
      {message.parts.map((part, index) => (
        part.type === 'text' ? (
          <span key={index}>{part.text}</span>
        ) : null
      ))}
      <button onClick={() => handleDelete(message.id)}>Delete</button>
    </div>
  ))}
  ...
```

You can think of `messages` and `setMessages` as a pair of `state` and `setState` in React.

### Cancellation and regeneration

It's also a common use case to abort the response message while it's still streaming back from the AI provider. You can do this by calling the `stop` function returned by the `useChat` hook.

```tsx
const { stop, status } = useChat()

return <>
  <button onClick={stop} disabled={!(status === 'streaming' || status === 'submitted')}>Stop</button>
  ...
```

When the user clicks the "Stop" button, the fetch request will be aborted. This avoids consuming unnecessary resources and improves the UX of your chatbot application.

Similarly, you can also request the AI provider to reprocess the last message by calling the `regenerate` function returned by the `useChat` hook:

```tsx
const { regenerate, status } = useChat();

return (
  <>
    <button
      onClick={regenerate}
      disabled={!(status === 'ready' || status === 'error')}
    >
      Regenerate
    </button>
    ...
  </>
);
```

When the user clicks the "Regenerate" button, the AI provider will regenerate the last message and replace the current one correspondingly.

### Throttling UI Updates

<Note>This feature is currently only available for React.</Note>

By default, the `useChat` hook will trigger a render every time a new chunk is received.
You can throttle the UI updates with the `experimental_throttle` option.

```tsx filename="page.tsx" highlight="2-3"
const { messages, ... } = useChat({
  // Throttle the messages and data updates to 50ms:
  experimental_throttle: 50
})
```

## Event Callbacks

`useChat` provides optional event callbacks that you can use to handle different stages of the chatbot lifecycle:

- `onFinish`: Called when the assistant response is completed. The event includes the response message, all messages, and flags for abort, disconnect, and errors.
- `onError`: Called when an error occurs during the fetch request.
- `onData`: Called whenever a data part is received.

These callbacks can be used to trigger additional actions, such as logging, analytics, or custom UI updates.

```tsx
import { UIMessage } from 'ai';

const {
  /* ... */
} = useChat({
  onFinish: ({ message, messages, isAbort, isDisconnect, isError }) => {
    // use information to e.g. update other UI states
  },
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', error);
  },
  onData: (data) => {
    console.log('Received data part from server:', data);
  },
});
```

It's worth noting that you can abort the processing by throwing an error in the `onData` callback. This will trigger the `onError` callback and stop the message from being appended to the chat UI. This can be useful for handling unexpected responses from the AI provider.

## Request Configuration

### Custom headers, body, and credentials

By default, the `useChat` hook sends a HTTP POST request to the `/api/chat` endpoint with the message list as the request body. You can customize the request in two ways:

#### Hook-Level Configuration (Applied to all requests)

You can configure transport-level options that will be applied to all requests made by the hook:

```tsx
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { DefaultChatTransport } from 'ai';

const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat({
  transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
    api: '/api/custom-chat',
    headers: {
      Authorization: 'your_token',
    },
    body: {
      user_id: '123',
    },
    credentials: 'same-origin',
  }),
});
```

#### Dynamic Hook-Level Configuration

You can also provide functions that return configuration values. This is useful for authentication tokens that need to be refreshed, or for configuration that depends on runtime conditions:

```tsx
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { DefaultChatTransport } from 'ai';

const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat({
  transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
    api: '/api/custom-chat',
    headers: () => ({
      Authorization: `Bearer ${getAuthToken()}`,
      'X-User-ID': getCurrentUserId(),
    }),
    body: () => ({
      sessionId: getCurrentSessionId(),
      preferences: getUserPreferences(),
    }),
    credentials: () => 'include',
  }),
});
```

<Note>
  For component state that changes over time, use `useRef` to store the current
  value and reference `ref.current` in your configuration function, or prefer
  request-level options (see next section) for better reliability.
</Note>

#### Request-Level Configuration (Recommended)

<Note>
  **Recommended**: Use request-level options for better flexibility and control.
  Request-level options take precedence over hook-level options and allow you to
  customize each request individually.
</Note>

```tsx
// Pass options as the second parameter to sendMessage
sendMessage(
  { text: input },
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: 'Bearer token123',
      'X-Custom-Header': 'custom-value',
    },
    body: {
      temperature: 0.7,
      max_tokens: 100,
      user_id: '123',
    },
    metadata: {
      userId: 'user123',
      sessionId: 'session456',
    },
  }
);
```

The request-level options are merged with hook-level options, with request-level options taking precedence. On your server side, you can handle the request with this additional information.

### Setting custom body fields per request

You can configure custom `body` fields on a per-request basis using the second parameter of the `sendMessage` function.
This is useful if you want to pass in additional information to your backend that is not part of the message list.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" highlight="20-25"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat();
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');

  return (
    <div>
      {messages.map((m) => (
        <div key={m.id}>
          {m.role}:{' '}
          {m.parts.map((part, index) =>
            part.type === 'text' ? <span key={index}>{part.text}</span> : null
          )}
        </div>
      ))}

      <form
        onSubmit={(event) => {
          event.preventDefault();
          if (input.trim()) {
            sendMessage(
              { text: input },
              {
                body: {
                  customKey: 'customValue',
                },
              }
            );
            setInput('');
          }
        }}
      >
        <input value={input} onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)} />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

You can retrieve these custom fields on your server side by destructuring the request body:

```ts filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" highlight="3,4"
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  // Extract additional information ("customKey") from the body of the request:
  const { messages, customKey }: { messages: UIMessage[]; customKey: string } =
    await req.json();
  //...
}
```

## Message Metadata

You can attach custom metadata to messages for tracking information like timestamps, model details, and token usage.

```ts
// Server: Send metadata about the message
return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse({
  messageMetadata: ({ part }) => {
    if (part.type === 'start') {
      return {
        createdAt: Date.now(),
        model: 'gpt-5.1',
      };
    }

    if (part.type === 'finish') {
      return {
        totalTokens: part.totalUsage.totalTokens,
      };
    }
  },
});
```

```tsx
// Client: Access metadata via message.metadata
{
  messages.map((message) => (
    <div key={message.id}>
      {message.role}:{' '}
      {message.metadata?.createdAt &&
        new Date(message.metadata.createdAt).toLocaleTimeString()}
      {/* Render message content */}
      {message.parts.map((part, index) =>
        part.type === 'text' ? <span key={index}>{part.text}</span> : null
      )}
      {/* Show token count if available */}
      {message.metadata?.totalTokens && (
        <span>{message.metadata.totalTokens} tokens</span>
      )}
    </div>
  ));
}
```

For complete examples with type safety and advanced use cases, see the [Message Metadata documentation](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/message-metadata).

## Transport Configuration

You can configure custom transport behavior using the `transport` option to customize how messages are sent to your API:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { DefaultChatTransport } from 'ai';

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat({
    id: 'my-chat',
    transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
      prepareSendMessagesRequest: ({ id, messages }) => {
        return {
          body: {
            id,
            message: messages[messages.length - 1],
          },
        };
      },
    }),
  });

  // ... rest of your component
}
```

The corresponding API route receives the custom request format:

```ts filename="app/api/chat/route.ts"
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { id, message } = await req.json();

  // Load existing messages and add the new one
  const messages = await loadMessages(id);
  messages.push(message);

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

### Advanced: Trigger-based routing

For more complex scenarios like message regeneration, you can use trigger-based routing:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { DefaultChatTransport } from 'ai';

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages, sendMessage, regenerate } = useChat({
    id: 'my-chat',
    transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
      prepareSendMessagesRequest: ({ id, messages, trigger, messageId }) => {
        if (trigger === 'submit-user-message') {
          return {
            body: {
              trigger: 'submit-user-message',
              id,
              message: messages[messages.length - 1],
              messageId,
            },
          };
        } else if (trigger === 'regenerate-assistant-message') {
          return {
            body: {
              trigger: 'regenerate-assistant-message',
              id,
              messageId,
            },
          };
        }
        throw new Error(`Unsupported trigger: ${trigger}`);
      },
    }),
  });

  // ... rest of your component
}
```

The corresponding API route would handle different triggers:

```ts filename="app/api/chat/route.ts"
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { trigger, id, message, messageId } = await req.json();

  const chat = await readChat(id);
  let messages = chat.messages;

  if (trigger === 'submit-user-message') {
    // Handle new user message
    messages = [...messages, message];
  } else if (trigger === 'regenerate-assistant-message') {
    // Handle message regeneration - remove messages after messageId
    const messageIndex = messages.findIndex((m) => m.id === messageId);
    if (messageIndex !== -1) {
      messages = messages.slice(0, messageIndex);
    }
  }

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

To learn more about building custom transports, refer to the [Transport API documentation](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/transport).

## Controlling the response stream

With `streamText`, you can control how error messages and usage information are sent back to the client.

### Error Messages

By default, the error message is masked for security reasons.
The default error message is "An error occurred."
You can forward error messages or send your own error message by providing a `getErrorMessage` function:

```ts filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" highlight="13-27"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { convertToModelMessages, streamText, UIMessage } from 'ai';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse({
    onError: (error) => {
      if (error == null) {
        return 'unknown error';
      }

      if (typeof error === 'string') {
        return error;
      }

      if (error instanceof Error) {
        return error.message;
      }

      return JSON.stringify(error);
    },
  });
}
```

### Usage Information

Track token consumption and resource usage with [message metadata](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/message-metadata):

1. Define a custom metadata type with usage fields (optional, for type safety)
2. Attach usage data using `messageMetadata` in your response
3. Display usage metrics in your UI components

Usage data is attached as metadata to messages and becomes available once the model completes its response generation.

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import {
  convertToModelMessages,
  streamText,
  UIMessage,
  type LanguageModelUsage,
} from 'ai';

// Create a new metadata type (optional for type-safety)
type MyMetadata = {
  totalUsage: LanguageModelUsage;
};

// Create a new custom message type with your own metadata
export type MyUIMessage = UIMessage<MyMetadata>;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: MyUIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse({
    originalMessages: messages,
    messageMetadata: ({ part }) => {
      // Send total usage when generation is finished
      if (part.type === 'finish') {
        return { totalUsage: part.totalUsage };
      }
    },
  });
}
```

Then, on the client, you can access the message-level metadata.

```tsx
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import type { MyUIMessage } from './api/chat/route';
import { DefaultChatTransport } from 'ai';

export default function Chat() {
  // Use custom message type defined on the server (optional for type-safety)
  const { messages } = useChat<MyUIMessage>({
    transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
      api: '/api/chat',
    }),
  });

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col w-full max-w-md py-24 mx-auto stretch">
      {messages.map((m) => (
        <div key={m.id} className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
          {m.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
          {m.parts.map((part) => {
            if (part.type === 'text') {
              return part.text;
            }
          })}
          {/* Render usage via metadata */}
          {m.metadata?.totalUsage && (
            <div>Total usage: {m.metadata?.totalUsage.totalTokens} tokens</div>
          )}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

You can also access your metadata from the `onFinish` callback of `useChat`:

```tsx
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import type { MyUIMessage } from './api/chat/route';
import { DefaultChatTransport } from 'ai';

export default function Chat() {
  // Use custom message type defined on the server (optional for type-safety)
  const { messages } = useChat<MyUIMessage>({
    transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
      api: '/api/chat',
    }),
    onFinish: ({ message }) => {
      // Access message metadata via onFinish callback
      console.log(message.metadata?.totalUsage);
    },
  });
}
```

### Text Streams

`useChat` can handle plain text streams by setting the `streamProtocol` option to `text`:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" highlight="7"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { TextStreamChatTransport } from 'ai';

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages } = useChat({
    transport: new TextStreamChatTransport({
      api: '/api/chat',
    }),
  });

  return <>...</>;
}
```

This configuration also works with other backend servers that stream plain text.
Check out the [stream protocol guide](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/stream-protocol) for more information.

<Note>
  When using `TextStreamChatTransport`, tool calls, usage information and finish
  reasons are not available.
</Note>

## Reasoning

Some models such as as DeepSeek `deepseek-r1`
and Anthropic `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219` support reasoning tokens.
These tokens are typically sent before the message content.
You can forward them to the client with the `sendReasoning` option:

```ts filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" highlight="13"
import { convertToModelMessages, streamText, UIMessage } from 'ai';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'deepseek/deepseek-r1',
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse({
    sendReasoning: true,
  });
}
```

On the client side, you can access the reasoning parts of the message object.

Reasoning parts have a `text` property that contains the reasoning content.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
messages.map((message) => (
  <div key={message.id}>
    {message.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
    {message.parts.map((part, index) => {
      // text parts:
      if (part.type === 'text') {
        return <div key={index}>{part.text}</div>;
      }

      // reasoning parts:
      if (part.type === 'reasoning') {
        return <pre key={index}>{part.text}</pre>;
      }
    })}
  </div>
));
```

## Sources

Some providers such as [Perplexity](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/perplexity#sources) and
[Google Generative AI](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/google-generative-ai#sources) include sources in the response.

Currently sources are limited to web pages that ground the response.
You can forward them to the client with the `sendSources` option:

```ts filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" highlight="13"
import { convertToModelMessages, streamText, UIMessage } from 'ai';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'perplexity/sonar-pro',
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse({
    sendSources: true,
  });
}
```

On the client side, you can access source parts of the message object.
There are two types of sources: `source-url` for web pages and `source-document` for documents.
Here is an example that renders both types of sources:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
messages.map((message) => (
  <div key={message.id}>
    {message.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}

    {/* Render URL sources */}
    {message.parts
      .filter((part) => part.type === 'source-url')
      .map((part) => (
        <span key={`source-${part.id}`}>
          [
          <a href={part.url} target="_blank">
            {part.title ?? new URL(part.url).hostname}
          </a>
          ]
        </span>
      ))}

    {/* Render document sources */}
    {message.parts
      .filter((part) => part.type === 'source-document')
      .map((part) => (
        <span key={`source-${part.id}`}>
          [<span>{part.title ?? `Document ${part.id}`}</span>]
        </span>
      ))}
  </div>
));
```

## Image Generation

Some models such as Google `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` support image generation.
When images are generated, they are exposed as files to the client.
On the client side, you can access file parts of the message object
and render them as images.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
messages.map((message) => (
  <div key={message.id}>
    {message.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
    {message.parts.map((part, index) => {
      if (part.type === 'text') {
        return <div key={index}>{part.text}</div>;
      } else if (part.type === 'file' && part.mediaType.startsWith('image/')) {
        return <img key={index} src={part.url} alt="Generated image" />;
      }
    })}
  </div>
));
```

## Attachments

The `useChat` hook supports sending file attachments along with a message as well as rendering them on the client. This can be useful for building applications that involve sending images, files, or other media content to the AI provider.

There are two ways to send files with a message: using a `FileList` object from file inputs or using an array of file objects.

### FileList

By using `FileList`, you can send multiple files as attachments along with a message using the file input element. The `useChat` hook will automatically convert them into data URLs and send them to the AI provider.

<Note>
  Currently, only `image/*` and `text/*` content types get automatically
  converted into [multi-modal content
  parts](/docs/foundations/prompts#multi-modal-messages). You will need to
  handle other content types manually.
</Note>

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { useRef, useState } from 'react';

export default function Page() {
  const { messages, sendMessage, status } = useChat();

  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const [files, setFiles] = useState<FileList | undefined>(undefined);
  const fileInputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        {messages.map((message) => (
          <div key={message.id}>
            <div>{`${message.role}: `}</div>

            <div>
              {message.parts.map((part, index) => {
                if (part.type === 'text') {
                  return <span key={index}>{part.text}</span>;
                }

                if (
                  part.type === 'file' &&
                  part.mediaType?.startsWith('image/')
                ) {
                  return <img key={index} src={part.url} alt={part.filename} />;
                }

                return null;
              })}
            </div>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>

      <form
        onSubmit={(event) => {
          event.preventDefault();
          if (input.trim()) {
            sendMessage({
              text: input,
              files,
            });
            setInput('');
            setFiles(undefined);

            if (fileInputRef.current) {
              fileInputRef.current.value = '';
            }
          }
        }}
      >
        <input
          type="file"
          onChange={(event) => {
            if (event.target.files) {
              setFiles(event.target.files);
            }
          }}
          multiple
          ref={fileInputRef}
        />
        <input
          value={input}
          placeholder="Send message..."
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
          disabled={status !== 'ready'}
        />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### File Objects

You can also send files as objects along with a message. This can be useful for sending pre-uploaded files or data URLs.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { useState } from 'react';
import { FileUIPart } from 'ai';

export default function Page() {
  const { messages, sendMessage, status } = useChat();

  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const [files] = useState<FileUIPart[]>([
    {
      type: 'file',
      filename: 'earth.png',
      mediaType: 'image/png',
      url: 'https://example.com/earth.png',
    },
    {
      type: 'file',
      filename: 'moon.png',
      mediaType: 'image/png',
      url: 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo...',
    },
  ]);

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        {messages.map((message) => (
          <div key={message.id}>
            <div>{`${message.role}: `}</div>

            <div>
              {message.parts.map((part, index) => {
                if (part.type === 'text') {
                  return <span key={index}>{part.text}</span>;
                }

                if (
                  part.type === 'file' &&
                  part.mediaType?.startsWith('image/')
                ) {
                  return <img key={index} src={part.url} alt={part.filename} />;
                }

                return null;
              })}
            </div>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>

      <form
        onSubmit={(event) => {
          event.preventDefault();
          if (input.trim()) {
            sendMessage({
              text: input,
              files,
            });
            setInput('');
          }
        }}
      >
        <input
          value={input}
          placeholder="Send message..."
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
          disabled={status !== 'ready'}
        />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Type Inference for Tools

When working with tools in TypeScript, AI SDK UI provides type inference helpers to ensure type safety for your tool inputs and outputs.

### InferUITool

The `InferUITool` type helper infers the input and output types of a single tool for use in UI messages:

```tsx
import { InferUITool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const weatherTool = {
  description: 'Get the current weather',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    location: z.string().describe('The city and state'),
  }),
  execute: async ({ location }) => {
    return `The weather in ${location} is sunny.`;
  },
};

// Infer the types from the tool
type WeatherUITool = InferUITool<typeof weatherTool>;
// This creates a type with:
// {
//   input: { location: string };
//   output: string;
// }
```

### InferUITools

The `InferUITools` type helper infers the input and output types of a `ToolSet`:

```tsx
import { InferUITools, ToolSet } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const tools = {
  weather: {
    description: 'Get the current weather',
    inputSchema: z.object({
      location: z.string().describe('The city and state'),
    }),
    execute: async ({ location }) => {
      return `The weather in ${location} is sunny.`;
    },
  },
  calculator: {
    description: 'Perform basic arithmetic',
    inputSchema: z.object({
      operation: z.enum(['add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide']),
      a: z.number(),
      b: z.number(),
    }),
    execute: async ({ operation, a, b }) => {
      switch (operation) {
        case 'add':
          return a + b;
        case 'subtract':
          return a - b;
        case 'multiply':
          return a * b;
        case 'divide':
          return a / b;
      }
    },
  },
} satisfies ToolSet;

// Infer the types from the tool set
type MyUITools = InferUITools<typeof tools>;
// This creates a type with:
// {
//   weather: { input: { location: string }; output: string };
//   calculator: { input: { operation: 'add' | 'subtract' | 'multiply' | 'divide'; a: number; b: number }; output: number };
// }
```

### Using Inferred Types

You can use these inferred types to create a custom UIMessage type and pass it to various AI SDK UI functions:

```tsx
import { InferUITools, UIMessage, UIDataTypes } from 'ai';

type MyUITools = InferUITools<typeof tools>;
type MyUIMessage = UIMessage<never, UIDataTypes, MyUITools>;
```

Pass the custom type to `useChat` or `createUIMessageStream`:

```tsx
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { createUIMessageStream } from 'ai';
import type { MyUIMessage } from './types';

// With useChat
const { messages } = useChat<MyUIMessage>();

// With createUIMessageStream
const stream = createUIMessageStream<MyUIMessage>(/* ... */);
```

This provides full type safety for tool inputs and outputs on the client and server.

# Chatbot Message Persistence

Being able to store and load chat messages is crucial for most AI chatbots.
In this guide, we'll show how to implement message persistence with `useChat` and `streamText`.

<Note>
  This guide does not cover authorization, error handling, or other real-world
  considerations. It is intended to be a simple example of how to implement
  message persistence.
</Note>

## Starting a new chat

When the user navigates to the chat page without providing a chat ID,
we need to create a new chat and redirect to the chat page with the new chat ID.

```tsx filename="app/chat/page.tsx"
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';
import { createChat } from '@util/chat-store';

export default async function Page() {
  const id = await createChat(); // create a new chat
  redirect(`/chat/${id}`); // redirect to chat page, see below
}
```

Our example chat store implementation uses files to store the chat messages.
In a real-world application, you would use a database or a cloud storage service,
and get the chat ID from the database.
That being said, the function interfaces are designed to be easily replaced with other implementations.

```tsx filename="util/chat-store.ts"
import { generateId } from 'ai';
import { existsSync, mkdirSync } from 'fs';
import { writeFile } from 'fs/promises';
import path from 'path';

export async function createChat(): Promise<string> {
  const id = generateId(); // generate a unique chat ID
  await writeFile(getChatFile(id), '[]'); // create an empty chat file
  return id;
}

function getChatFile(id: string): string {
  const chatDir = path.join(process.cwd(), '.chats');
  if (!existsSync(chatDir)) mkdirSync(chatDir, { recursive: true });
  return path.join(chatDir, `${id}.json`);
}
```

## Loading an existing chat

When the user navigates to the chat page with a chat ID, we need to load the chat messages from storage.

The `loadChat` function in our file-based chat store is implemented as follows:

```tsx filename="util/chat-store.ts"
import { UIMessage } from 'ai';
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';

export async function loadChat(id: string): Promise<UIMessage[]> {
  return JSON.parse(await readFile(getChatFile(id), 'utf8'));
}

// ... rest of the file
```

## Validating messages on the server

When processing messages on the server that contain tool calls, custom metadata, or data parts, you should validate them using `validateUIMessages` before sending them to the model.

### Validation with tools

When your messages include tool calls, validate them against your tool definitions:

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" highlight="7-25,32-37"
import {
  convertToModelMessages,
  streamText,
  UIMessage,
  validateUIMessages,
  tool,
} from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';
import { loadChat, saveChat } from '@util/chat-store';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { dataPartsSchema, metadataSchema } from '@util/schemas';

// Define your tools
const tools = {
  weather: tool({
    description: 'Get weather information',
    parameters: z.object({
      location: z.string(),
      units: z.enum(['celsius', 'fahrenheit']),
    }),
    execute: async ({ location, units }) => {
      /* tool implementation */
    },
  }),
  // other tools
};

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { message, id } = await req.json();

  // Load previous messages from database
  const previousMessages = await loadChat(id);

  // Append new message to previousMessages messages
  const messages = [...previousMessages, message];

  // Validate loaded messages against
  // tools, data parts schema, and metadata schema
  const validatedMessages = await validateUIMessages({
    messages,
    tools, // Ensures tool calls in messages match current schemas
    dataPartsSchema,
    metadataSchema,
  });

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'openai/gpt-5-mini',
    messages: convertToModelMessages(validatedMessages),
    tools,
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse({
    originalMessages: messages,
    onFinish: ({ messages }) => {
      saveChat({ chatId: id, messages });
    },
  });
}
```

### Handling validation errors

Handle validation errors gracefully when messages from the database don't match current schemas:

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" highlight="3,10-24"
import {
  convertToModelMessages,
  streamText,
  validateUIMessages,
  TypeValidationError,
} from 'ai';
import { type MyUIMessage } from '@/types';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { message, id } = await req.json();

  // Load and validate messages from database
  let validatedMessages: MyUIMessage[];

  try {
    const previousMessages = await loadMessagesFromDB(id);
    validatedMessages = await validateUIMessages({
      // append the new message to the previous messages:
      messages: [...previousMessages, message],
      tools,
      metadataSchema,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof TypeValidationError) {
      // Log validation error for monitoring
      console.error('Database messages validation failed:', error);
      // Could implement message migration or filtering here
      // For now, start with empty history
      validatedMessages = [];
    } else {
      throw error;
    }
  }

  // Continue with validated messages...
}
```

## Displaying the chat

Once messages are loaded from storage, you can display them in your chat UI. Here's how to set up the page component and the chat display:

```tsx filename="app/chat/[id]/page.tsx"
import { loadChat } from '@util/chat-store';
import Chat from '@ui/chat';

export default async function Page(props: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
  const { id } = await props.params;
  const messages = await loadChat(id);
  return <Chat id={id} initialMessages={messages} />;
}
```

The chat component uses the `useChat` hook to manage the conversation:

```tsx filename="ui/chat.tsx" highlight="10-16"
'use client';

import { UIMessage, useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { DefaultChatTransport } from 'ai';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Chat({
  id,
  initialMessages,
}: { id?: string | undefined; initialMessages?: UIMessage[] } = {}) {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const { sendMessage, messages } = useChat({
    id, // use the provided chat ID
    messages: initialMessages, // load initial messages
    transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
      api: '/api/chat',
    }),
  });

  const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (input.trim()) {
      sendMessage({ text: input });
      setInput('');
    }
  };

  // simplified rendering code, extend as needed:
  return (
    <div>
      {messages.map((m) => (
        <div key={m.id}>
          {m.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
          {m.parts
            .map((part) => (part.type === 'text' ? part.text : ''))
            .join('')}
        </div>
      ))}

      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          value={input}
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Type a message..."
        />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Storing messages

`useChat` sends the chat id and the messages to the backend.

<Note>
  The `useChat` message format is different from the `ModelMessage` format. The
  `useChat` message format is designed for frontend display, and contains
  additional fields such as `id` and `createdAt`. We recommend storing the
  messages in the `useChat` message format.

When loading messages from storage that contain tools, metadata, or custom data
parts, validate them using `validateUIMessages` before processing (see the
[validation section](#validating-messages-from-database) above).

</Note>

Storing messages is done in the `onFinish` callback of the `toUIMessageStreamResponse` function.
`onFinish` receives the complete messages including the new AI response as `UIMessage[]`.

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" highlight="6,11-17"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { saveChat } from '@util/chat-store';
import { convertToModelMessages, streamText, UIMessage } from 'ai';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages, chatId }: { messages: UIMessage[]; chatId: string } =
    await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'openai/gpt-5-mini',
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse({
    originalMessages: messages,
    onFinish: ({ messages }) => {
      saveChat({ chatId, messages });
    },
  });
}
```

The actual storage of the messages is done in the `saveChat` function, which in
our file-based chat store is implemented as follows:

```tsx filename="util/chat-store.ts"
import { UIMessage } from 'ai';
import { writeFile } from 'fs/promises';

export async function saveChat({
  chatId,
  messages,
}: {
  chatId: string;
  messages: UIMessage[];
}): Promise<void> {
  const content = JSON.stringify(messages, null, 2);
  await writeFile(getChatFile(chatId), content);
}

// ... rest of the file
```

## Message IDs

In addition to a chat ID, each message has an ID.
You can use this message ID to e.g. manipulate individual messages.

### Client-side vs Server-side ID Generation

By default, message IDs are generated client-side:

- User message IDs are generated by the `useChat` hook on the client
- AI response message IDs are generated by `streamText` on the server

For applications without persistence, client-side ID generation works perfectly.
However, **for persistence, you need server-side generated IDs** to ensure consistency across sessions and prevent ID conflicts when messages are stored and retrieved.

### Setting Up Server-side ID Generation

When implementing persistence, you have two options for generating server-side IDs:

1. **Using `generateMessageId` in `toUIMessageStreamResponse`**
2. **Setting IDs in your start message part with `createUIMessageStream`**

#### Option 1: Using `generateMessageId` in `toUIMessageStreamResponse`

You can control the ID format by providing ID generators using [`createIdGenerator()`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/create-id-generator):

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" highlight="7-11"
import { createIdGenerator, streamText } from 'ai';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  // ...
  const result = streamText({
    // ...
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse({
    originalMessages: messages,
    // Generate consistent server-side IDs for persistence:
    generateMessageId: createIdGenerator({
      prefix: 'msg',
      size: 16,
    }),
    onFinish: ({ messages }) => {
      saveChat({ chatId, messages });
    },
  });
}
```

#### Option 2: Setting IDs with `createUIMessageStream`

Alternatively, you can use `createUIMessageStream` to control the message ID by writing a start message part:

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" highlight="8-18"
import {
  generateId,
  streamText,
  createUIMessageStream,
  createUIMessageStreamResponse,
} from 'ai';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages, chatId } = await req.json();

  const stream = createUIMessageStream({
    execute: ({ writer }) => {
      // Write start message part with custom ID
      writer.write({
        type: 'start',
        messageId: generateId(), // Generate server-side ID for persistence
      });

      const result = streamText({
        model: 'openai/gpt-5-mini',
        messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
      });

      writer.merge(result.toUIMessageStream({ sendStart: false })); // omit start message part
    },
    originalMessages: messages,
    onFinish: ({ responseMessage }) => {
      // save your chat here
    },
  });

  return createUIMessageStreamResponse({ stream });
}
```

<Note>
  For client-side applications that don't require persistence, you can still customize client-side ID generation:

```tsx filename="ui/chat.tsx"
import { createIdGenerator } from 'ai';
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';

const { ... } = useChat({
  generateId: createIdGenerator({
    prefix: 'msgc',
    size: 16,
  }),
  // ...
});
```

</Note>

## Sending only the last message

Once you have implemented message persistence, you might want to send only the last message to the server.
This reduces the amount of data sent to the server on each request and can improve performance.

To achieve this, you can provide a `prepareSendMessagesRequest` function to the transport.
This function receives the messages and the chat ID, and returns the request body to be sent to the server.

```tsx filename="ui/chat.tsx" highlight="7-12"
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { DefaultChatTransport } from 'ai';

const {
  // ...
} = useChat({
  // ...
  transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
    api: '/api/chat',
    // only send the last message to the server:
    prepareSendMessagesRequest({ messages, id }) {
      return { body: { message: messages[messages.length - 1], id } };
    },
  }),
});
```

On the server, you can then load the previous messages and append the new message to the previous messages. If your messages contain tools, metadata, or custom data parts, you should validate them:

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" highlight="2-11,14-18"
import { convertToModelMessages, UIMessage, validateUIMessages } from 'ai';
// import your tools and schemas

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  // get the last message from the client:
  const { message, id } = await req.json();

  // load the previous messages from the server:
  const previousMessages = await loadChat(id);

  // validate messages if they contain tools, metadata, or data parts:
  const validatedMessages = await validateUIMessages({
    // append the new message to the previous messages:
    messages: [...previousMessages, message],
    tools, // if using tools
    metadataSchema, // if using custom metadata
    dataSchemas, // if using custom data parts
  });

  const result = streamText({
    // ...
    messages: convertToModelMessages(validatedMessages),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse({
    originalMessages: validatedMessages,
    onFinish: ({ messages }) => {
      saveChat({ chatId: id, messages });
    },
  });
}
```

## Handling client disconnects

By default, the AI SDK `streamText` function uses backpressure to the language model provider to prevent
the consumption of tokens that are not yet requested.

However, this means that when the client disconnects, e.g. by closing the browser tab or because of a network issue,
the stream from the LLM will be aborted and the conversation may end up in a broken state.

Assuming that you have a [storage solution](#storing-messages) in place, you can use the `consumeStream` method to consume the stream on the backend,
and then save the result as usual.
`consumeStream` effectively removes the backpressure,
meaning that the result is stored even when the client has already disconnected.

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" highlight="19-21"
import { convertToModelMessages, streamText, UIMessage } from 'ai';
import { saveChat } from '@util/chat-store';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages, chatId }: { messages: UIMessage[]; chatId: string } =
    await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model,
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
  });

  // consume the stream to ensure it runs to completion & triggers onFinish
  // even when the client response is aborted:
  result.consumeStream(); // no await

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse({
    originalMessages: messages,
    onFinish: ({ messages }) => {
      saveChat({ chatId, messages });
    },
  });
}
```

When the client reloads the page after a disconnect, the chat will be restored from the storage solution.

<Note>
  In production applications, you would also track the state of the request (in
  progress, complete) in your stored messages and use it on the client to cover
  the case where the client reloads the page after a disconnection, but the
  streaming is not yet complete.
</Note>

For more robust handling of disconnects, you may want to add resumability on disconnects. Check out the [Chatbot Resume Streams](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot-resume-streams) documentation to learn more.

# Chatbot Resume Streams

`useChat` supports resuming ongoing streams after page reloads. Use this feature to build applications with long-running generations.

<Note type="warning">
  Stream resumption is not compatible with abort functionality. Closing a tab or
  refreshing the page triggers an abort signal that will break the resumption
  mechanism. Do not use `resume: true` if you need abort functionality in your
  application. See
  [troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting/abort-breaks-resumable-streams) for
  more details.
</Note>

## How stream resumption works

Stream resumption requires persistence for messages and active streams in your application. The AI SDK provides tools to connect to storage, but you need to set up the storage yourself.

**The AI SDK provides:**

- A `resume` option in `useChat` that automatically reconnects to active streams
- Access to the outgoing stream through the `consumeSseStream` callback
- Automatic HTTP requests to your resume endpoints

**You build:**

- Storage to track which stream belongs to each chat
- Redis to store the UIMessage stream
- Two API endpoints: POST to create streams, GET to resume them
- Integration with [`resumable-stream`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resumable-stream) to manage Redis storage

## Prerequisites

To implement resumable streams in your chat application, you need:

1. **The `resumable-stream` package** - Handles the publisher/subscriber mechanism for streams
2. **A Redis instance** - Stores stream data (e.g. [Redis through Vercel](https://vercel.com/marketplace/redis))
3. **A persistence layer** - Tracks which stream ID is active for each chat (e.g. database)

## Implementation

### 1. Client-side: Enable stream resumption

Use the `resume` option in the `useChat` hook to enable stream resumption. When `resume` is true, the hook automatically attempts to reconnect to any active stream for the chat on mount:

```tsx filename="app/chat/[chatId]/chat.tsx"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { DefaultChatTransport, type UIMessage } from 'ai';

export function Chat({
  chatData,
  resume = false,
}: {
  chatData: { id: string; messages: UIMessage[] };
  resume?: boolean;
}) {
  const { messages, sendMessage, status } = useChat({
    id: chatData.id,
    messages: chatData.messages,
    resume, // Enable automatic stream resumption
    transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
      // You must send the id of the chat
      prepareSendMessagesRequest: ({ id, messages }) => {
        return {
          body: {
            id,
            message: messages[messages.length - 1],
          },
        };
      },
    }),
  });

  return <div>{/* Your chat UI */}</div>;
}
```

<Note>
  You must send the chat ID with each request (see
  `prepareSendMessagesRequest`).
</Note>

When you enable `resume`, the `useChat` hook makes a `GET` request to `/api/chat/[id]/stream` on mount to check for and resume any active streams.

Let's start by creating the POST handler to create the resumable stream.

### 2. Create the POST handler

The POST handler creates resumable streams using the `consumeSseStream` callback:

```ts filename="app/api/chat/route.ts"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { readChat, saveChat } from '@util/chat-store';
import {
  convertToModelMessages,
  generateId,
  streamText,
  type UIMessage,
} from 'ai';
import { after } from 'next/server';
import { createResumableStreamContext } from 'resumable-stream';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const {
    message,
    id,
  }: {
    message: UIMessage | undefined;
    id: string;
  } = await req.json();

  const chat = await readChat(id);
  let messages = chat.messages;

  messages = [...messages, message!];

  // Clear any previous active stream and save the user message
  saveChat({ id, messages, activeStreamId: null });

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'openai/gpt-5-mini',
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse({
    originalMessages: messages,
    generateMessageId: generateId,
    onFinish: ({ messages }) => {
      // Clear the active stream when finished
      saveChat({ id, messages, activeStreamId: null });
    },
    async consumeSseStream({ stream }) {
      const streamId = generateId();

      // Create a resumable stream from the SSE stream
      const streamContext = createResumableStreamContext({ waitUntil: after });
      await streamContext.createNewResumableStream(streamId, () => stream);

      // Update the chat with the active stream ID
      saveChat({ id, activeStreamId: streamId });
    },
  });
}
```

### 3. Implement the GET handler

Create a GET handler at `/api/chat/[id]/stream` that:

1. Reads the chat ID from the route params
2. Loads the chat data to check for an active stream
3. Returns 204 (No Content) if no stream is active
4. Resumes the existing stream if one is found

```ts filename="app/api/chat/[id]/stream/route.ts"
import { readChat } from '@util/chat-store';
import { UI_MESSAGE_STREAM_HEADERS } from 'ai';
import { after } from 'next/server';
import { createResumableStreamContext } from 'resumable-stream';

export async function GET(
  _: Request,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }
) {
  const { id } = await params;

  const chat = await readChat(id);

  if (chat.activeStreamId == null) {
    // no content response when there is no active stream
    return new Response(null, { status: 204 });
  }

  const streamContext = createResumableStreamContext({
    waitUntil: after,
  });

  return new Response(
    await streamContext.resumeExistingStream(chat.activeStreamId),
    { headers: UI_MESSAGE_STREAM_HEADERS }
  );
}
```

<Note>
  The `after` function from Next.js allows work to continue after the response
  has been sent. This ensures that the resumable stream persists in Redis even
  after the initial response is returned to the client, enabling reconnection
  later.
</Note>

## How it works

### Request lifecycle

![Diagram showing the architecture and lifecycle of resumable stream requests](https://e742qlubrjnjqpp0.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/resume-stream-diagram.png)

The diagram above shows the complete lifecycle of a resumable stream:

1. **Stream creation**: When you send a new message, the POST handler uses `streamText` to generate the response. The `consumeSseStream` callback creates a resumable stream with a unique ID and stores it in Redis through the `resumable-stream` package
2. **Stream tracking**: Your persistence layer saves the `activeStreamId` in the chat data
3. **Client reconnection**: When the client reconnects (page reload), the `resume` option triggers a GET request to `/api/chat/[id]/stream`
4. **Stream recovery**: The GET handler checks for an `activeStreamId` and uses `resumeExistingStream` to reconnect. If no active stream exists, it returns a 204 (No Content) response
5. **Completion cleanup**: When the stream finishes, the `onFinish` callback clears the `activeStreamId` by setting it to `null`

## Customize the resume endpoint

By default, the `useChat` hook makes a GET request to `/api/chat/[id]/stream` when resuming. Customize this endpoint, credentials, and headers, using the `prepareReconnectToStreamRequest` option in `DefaultChatTransport`:

```tsx filename="app/chat/[chatId]/chat.tsx"
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { DefaultChatTransport } from 'ai';

export function Chat({ chatData, resume }) {
  const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat({
    id: chatData.id,
    messages: chatData.messages,
    resume,
    transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
      // Customize reconnect settings (optional)
      prepareReconnectToStreamRequest: ({ id }) => {
        return {
          api: `/api/chat/${id}/stream`, // Default pattern
          // Or use a different pattern:
          // api: `/api/streams/${id}/resume`,
          // api: `/api/resume-chat?id=${id}`,
          credentials: 'include', // Include cookies/auth
          headers: {
            Authorization: 'Bearer token',
            'X-Custom-Header': 'value',
          },
        };
      },
    }),
  });

  return <div>{/* Your chat UI */}</div>;
}
```

This lets you:

- Match your existing API route structure
- Add query parameters or custom paths
- Integrate with different backend architectures

## Important considerations

- **Incompatibility with abort**: Stream resumption is not compatible with abort functionality. Closing a tab or refreshing the page triggers an abort signal that will break the resumption mechanism. Do not use `resume: true` if you need abort functionality in your application
- **Stream expiration**: Streams in Redis expire after a set time (configurable in the `resumable-stream` package)
- **Multiple clients**: Multiple clients can connect to the same stream simultaneously
- **Error handling**: When no active stream exists, the GET handler returns a 204 (No Content) status code
- **Security**: Ensure proper authentication and authorization for both creating and resuming streams
- **Race conditions**: Clear the `activeStreamId` when starting a new stream to prevent resuming outdated streams

title: Chatbot Tool Usage
description: Learn how to use tools with the useChat hook.

# Chatbot Tool Usage

With [`useChat`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat) and [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text), you can use tools in your chatbot application.
The AI SDK supports three types of tools in this context:

1. Automatically executed server-side tools
2. Automatically executed client-side tools
3. Tools that require user interaction, such as confirmation dialogs

The flow is as follows:

1. The user enters a message in the chat UI.
1. The message is sent to the API route.
1. In your server side route, the language model generates tool calls during the `streamText` call.
1. All tool calls are forwarded to the client.
1. Server-side tools are executed using their `execute` method and their results are forwarded to the client.
1. Client-side tools that should be automatically executed are handled with the `onToolCall` callback.
   You must call `addToolOutput` to provide the tool result.
1. Client-side tool that require user interactions can be displayed in the UI.
   The tool calls and results are available as tool invocation parts in the `parts` property of the last assistant message.
1. When the user interaction is done, `addToolOutput` can be used to add the tool result to the chat.
1. The chat can be configured to automatically submit when all tool results are available using `sendAutomaticallyWhen`.
   This triggers another iteration of this flow.

The tool calls and tool executions are integrated into the assistant message as typed tool parts.
A tool part is at first a tool call, and then it becomes a tool result when the tool is executed.
The tool result contains all information about the tool call as well as the result of the tool execution.

<Note>
  Tool result submission can be configured using the `sendAutomaticallyWhen`
  option. You can use the `lastAssistantMessageIsCompleteWithToolCalls` helper
  to automatically submit when all tool results are available. This simplifies
  the client-side code while still allowing full control when needed.
</Note>

## Example

In this example, we'll use three tools:

- `getWeatherInformation`: An automatically executed server-side tool that returns the weather in a given city.
- `askForConfirmation`: A user-interaction client-side tool that asks the user for confirmation.
- `getLocation`: An automatically executed client-side tool that returns a random city.

### API route

```tsx filename='app/api/chat/route.ts'
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { convertToModelMessages, streamText, UIMessage } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

// Allow streaming responses up to 30 seconds
export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
    tools: {
      // server-side tool with execute function:
      getWeatherInformation: {
        description: 'show the weather in a given city to the user',
        inputSchema: z.object({ city: z.string() }),
        execute: async ({}: { city: string }) => {
          const weatherOptions = ['sunny', 'cloudy', 'rainy', 'snowy', 'windy'];
          return weatherOptions[
            Math.floor(Math.random() * weatherOptions.length)
          ];
        },
      },
      // client-side tool that starts user interaction:
      askForConfirmation: {
        description: 'Ask the user for confirmation.',
        inputSchema: z.object({
          message: z.string().describe('The message to ask for confirmation.'),
        }),
      },
      // client-side tool that is automatically executed on the client:
      getLocation: {
        description:
          'Get the user location. Always ask for confirmation before using this tool.',
        inputSchema: z.object({}),
      },
    },
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

### Client-side page

The client-side page uses the `useChat` hook to create a chatbot application with real-time message streaming.
Tool calls are displayed in the chat UI as typed tool parts.
Please make sure to render the messages using the `parts` property of the message.

There are three things worth mentioning:

1. The [`onToolCall`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat#on-tool-call) callback is used to handle client-side tools that should be automatically executed.
   In this example, the `getLocation` tool is a client-side tool that returns a random city.
   You call `addToolOutput` to provide the result (without `await` to avoid potential deadlocks).

   <Note>
     Always check `if (toolCall.dynamic)` first in your `onToolCall` handler.
     Without this check, TypeScript will throw an error like: `Type 'string' is
     not assignable to type '"toolName1" | "toolName2"'` when you try to use
     `toolCall.toolName` in `addToolOutput`.
   </Note>

2. The [`sendAutomaticallyWhen`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat#send-automatically-when) option with `lastAssistantMessageIsCompleteWithToolCalls` helper automatically submits when all tool results are available.

3. The `parts` array of assistant messages contains tool parts with typed names like `tool-askForConfirmation`.
   The client-side tool `askForConfirmation` is displayed in the UI.
   It asks the user for confirmation and displays the result once the user confirms or denies the execution.
   The result is added to the chat using `addToolOutput` with the `tool` parameter for type safety.

                  case 'input-available':
                    return (
                      <div key={callId}>
                        Getting weather information for {part.input.city}...
                      </div>
                    );
                  case 'output-available':

                      </div>
                    );
                  case 'output-error':
                    return (
                      <div key={callId}>
                        Error getting weather for {part.input.city}:{' '}
                        {part.errorText}
                      </div>
                    );
                }
                break;
              }
            }
          })}
          <br />
        </div>
      ))}

      <form
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          if (input.trim()) {
            sendMessage({ text: input });
            setInput('');
          }
        }}
      >
        <input value={input} onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)} />
      </form>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Error handling

Sometimes an error may occur during client-side tool execution. Use the `addToolOutput` method with a `state` of `output-error` and `errorText` value instead of `output` record the error.

```tsx filename='app/page.tsx' highlight="19,36-41"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import {
  DefaultChatTransport,
  lastAssistantMessageIsCompleteWithToolCalls,
} from 'ai';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages, sendMessage, addToolOutput } = useChat({
    transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
      api: '/api/chat',
    }),

    sendAutomaticallyWhen: lastAssistantMessageIsCompleteWithToolCalls,

    // run client-side tools that are automatically executed:
    async onToolCall({ toolCall }) {
      // Check if it's a dynamic tool first for proper type narrowing
      if (toolCall.dynamic) {
        return;
      }

      if (toolCall.toolName === 'getWeatherInformation') {
        try {
          const weather = await getWeatherInformation(toolCall.input);

          // No await - avoids potential deadlocks
          addToolOutput({
            tool: 'getWeatherInformation',
            toolCallId: toolCall.toolCallId,
            output: weather,
          });
        } catch (err) {
          addToolOutput({
            tool: 'getWeatherInformation',
            toolCallId: toolCall.toolCallId,
            state: 'output-error',
            errorText: 'Unable to get the weather information',
          });
        }
      }
    },
  });
}
```

## Dynamic Tools

When using dynamic tools (tools with unknown types at compile time), the UI parts use a generic `dynamic-tool` type instead of specific tool types:

```tsx filename='app/page.tsx'
{
  message.parts.map((part, index) => {
    switch (part.type) {
      // Static tools with specific (`tool-${toolName}`) types
      case 'tool-getWeatherInformation':
        return <WeatherDisplay part={part} />;

      // Dynamic tools use generic `dynamic-tool` type
      case 'dynamic-tool':
        return (
          <div key={index}>
            <h4>Tool: {part.toolName}</h4>
            {part.state === 'input-streaming' && (
              <pre>{JSON.stringify(part.input, null, 2)}</pre>
            )}
            {part.state === 'output-available' && (
              <pre>{JSON.stringify(part.output, null, 2)}</pre>
            )}
            {part.state === 'output-error' && (
              <div>Error: {part.errorText}</div>
            )}
          </div>
        );
    }
  });
}
```

Dynamic tools are useful when integrating with:

- MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools without schemas
- User-defined functions loaded at runtime
- External tool providers

## Tool call streaming

Tool call streaming is **enabled by default** in AI SDK 5.0, allowing you to stream tool calls while they are being generated. This provides a better user experience by showing tool inputs as they are generated in real-time.

```tsx filename='app/api/chat/route.ts'
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
    // toolCallStreaming is enabled by default in v5
    // ...
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

With tool call streaming enabled, partial tool calls are streamed as part of the data stream.
They are available through the `useChat` hook.
The typed tool parts of assistant messages will also contain partial tool calls.
You can use the `state` property of the tool part to render the correct UI.

```tsx filename='app/page.tsx' highlight="9,10"
export default function Chat() {
  // ...
  return (
    <>
      {messages?.map((message) => (
        <div key={message.id}>
          {message.parts.map((part) => {
            switch (part.type) {
              case 'tool-askForConfirmation':
              case 'tool-getLocation':
              case 'tool-getWeatherInformation':
                switch (part.state) {
                  case 'input-streaming':
                    return <pre>{JSON.stringify(part.input, null, 2)}</pre>;
                  case 'input-available':
                    return <pre>{JSON.stringify(part.input, null, 2)}</pre>;
                  case 'output-available':
                    return <pre>{JSON.stringify(part.output, null, 2)}</pre>;
                  case 'output-error':
                    return <div>Error: {part.errorText}</div>;
                }
            }
          })}
        </div>
      ))}
    </>
  );
}
```

## Step start parts

When you are using multi-step tool calls, the AI SDK will add step start parts to the assistant messages.
If you want to display boundaries between tool calls, you can use the `step-start` parts as follows:

```tsx filename='app/page.tsx'
// ...
// where you render the message parts:
message.parts.map((part, index) => {
  switch (part.type) {
    case 'step-start':
      // show step boundaries as horizontal lines:
      return index > 0 ? (
        <div key={index} className="text-gray-500">
          <hr className="my-2 border-gray-300" />
        </div>
      ) : null;
    case 'text':
    // ...
    case 'tool-askForConfirmation':
    case 'tool-getLocation':
    case 'tool-getWeatherInformation':
    // ...
  }
});
// ...
```

## Server-side Multi-Step Calls

You can also use multi-step calls on the server-side with `streamText`.
This works when all invoked tools have an `execute` function on the server side.

```tsx filename='app/api/chat/route.ts' highlight="15-21,24"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { convertToModelMessages, streamText, UIMessage, stepCountIs } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
    tools: {
      getWeatherInformation: {
        description: 'show the weather in a given city to the user',
        inputSchema: z.object({ city: z.string() }),
        // tool has execute function:
        execute: async ({}: { city: string }) => {
          const weatherOptions = ['sunny', 'cloudy', 'rainy', 'snowy', 'windy'];
          return weatherOptions[
            Math.floor(Math.random() * weatherOptions.length)
          ];
        },
      },
    },
    stopWhen: stepCountIs(5),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

## Errors

Language models can make errors when calling tools.
By default, these errors are masked for security reasons, and show up as "An error occurred" in the UI.

To surface the errors, you can use the `onError` function when calling `toUIMessageResponse`.

```tsx
export function errorHandler(error: unknown) {
  if (error == null) {
    return 'unknown error';
  }

  if (typeof error === 'string') {
    return error;
  }

  if (error instanceof Error) {
    return error.message;
  }

  return JSON.stringify(error);
}
```

```tsx
const result = streamText({
  // ...
});

return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse({
  onError: errorHandler,
});
```

In case you are using `createUIMessageResponse`, you can use the `onError` function when calling `toUIMessageResponse`:

```tsx
const response = createUIMessageResponse({
  // ...
  async execute(dataStream) {
    // ...
  },
  onError: (error) => `Custom error: ${error.message}`,
});
```

# Generative User Interfaces

Generative user interfaces (generative UI) is the process of allowing a large language model (LLM) to go beyond text and "generate UI". This creates a more engaging and AI-native experience for users.

<WeatherSearch />

At the core of generative UI are [ tools ](/docs/ai-sdk-core/tools-and-tool-calling), which are functions you provide to the model to perform specialized tasks like getting the weather in a location. The model can decide when and how to use these tools based on the context of the conversation.

Generative UI is the process of connecting the results of a tool call to a React component. Here's how it works:

1. You provide the model with a prompt or conversation history, along with a set of tools.
2. Based on the context, the model may decide to call a tool.
3. If a tool is called, it will execute and return data.
4. This data can then be passed to a React component for rendering.

By passing the tool results to React components, you can create a generative UI experience that's more engaging and adaptive to your needs.

## Build a Generative UI Chat Interface

Let's create a chat interface that handles text-based conversations and incorporates dynamic UI elements based on model responses.

### Basic Chat Implementation

Start with a basic chat implementation using the `useChat` hook:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Page() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat();

  const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    sendMessage({ text: input });
    setInput('');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {messages.map((message) => (
        <div key={message.id}>
          <div>{message.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}</div>
          <div>
            {message.parts.map((part, index) => {
              if (part.type === 'text') {
                return <span key={index}>{part.text}</span>;
              }
              return null;
            })}
          </div>
        </div>
      ))}

      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          value={input}
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Type a message..."
        />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

To handle the chat requests and model responses, set up an API route:

```ts filename="app/api/chat/route.ts"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { streamText, convertToModelMessages, UIMessage, stepCountIs } from 'ai';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await request.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    system: 'You are a friendly assistant!',
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
    stopWhen: stepCountIs(5),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

This API route uses the `streamText` function to process chat messages and stream the model's responses back to the client.

### Create a Tool

Before enhancing your chat interface with dynamic UI elements, you need to create a tool and corresponding React component. A tool will allow the model to perform a specific action, such as fetching weather information.

Create a new file called `ai/tools.ts` with the following content:

```ts filename="ai/tools.ts"
import { tool as createTool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

export const weatherTool = createTool({
  description: 'Display the weather for a location',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
  }),
  execute: async function ({ location }) {
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
    return { weather: 'Sunny', temperature: 75, location };
  },
});

export const tools = {
  displayWeather: weatherTool,
};
```

In this file, you've created a tool called `weatherTool`. This tool simulates fetching weather information for a given location. This tool will return simulated data after a 2-second delay. In a real-world application, you would replace this simulation with an actual API call to a weather service.

### Update the API Route

Update the API route to include the tool you've defined:

```ts filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" highlight="3,8,14"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { streamText, convertToModelMessages, UIMessage, stepCountIs } from 'ai';
import { tools } from '@/ai/tools';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await request.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    system: 'You are a friendly assistant!',
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
    stopWhen: stepCountIs(5),
    tools,
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

Now that you've defined the tool and added it to your `streamText` call, let's build a React component to display the weather information it returns.

### Create UI Components

Create a new file called `components/weather.tsx`:

```tsx filename="components/weather.tsx"
type WeatherProps = {
  temperature: number;
  weather: string;
  location: string;
};

export const Weather = ({ temperature, weather, location }: WeatherProps) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Current Weather for {location}</h2>
      <p>Condition: {weather}</p>
      <p>Temperature: {temperature}°C</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

This component will display the weather information for a given location. It takes three props: `temperature`, `weather`, and `location` (exactly what the `weatherTool` returns).

### Render the Weather Component

Now that you have your tool and corresponding React component, let's integrate them into your chat interface. You'll render the Weather component when the model calls the weather tool.

To check if the model has called a tool, you can check the `parts` array of the UIMessage object for tool-specific parts. In AI SDK 5.0, tool parts use typed naming: `tool-${toolName}` instead of generic types.

Update your `page.tsx` file:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" highlight="4,9,14-15,19-46"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Weather } from '@/components/weather';

export default function Page() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat();

  const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    sendMessage({ text: input });
    setInput('');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {messages.map((message) => (
        <div key={message.id}>
          <div>{message.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}</div>
          <div>
            {message.parts.map((part, index) => {
              if (part.type === 'text') {
                return <span key={index}>{part.text}</span>;
              }

              if (part.type === 'tool-displayWeather') {
                switch (part.state) {
                  case 'input-available':
                    return <div key={index}>Loading weather...</div>;
                  case 'output-available':
                    return (
                      <div key={index}>
                        <Weather {...part.output} />
                      </div>
                    );
                  case 'output-error':
                    return <div key={index}>Error: {part.errorText}</div>;
                  default:
                    return null;
                }
              }

              return null;
            })}
          </div>
        </div>
      ))}

      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          value={input}
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Type a message..."
        />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this updated code snippet, you:

1. Use manual input state management with `useState` instead of the built-in `input` and `handleInputChange`.
2. Use `sendMessage` instead of `handleSubmit` to send messages.
3. Check the `parts` array of each message for different content types.
4. Handle tool parts with type `tool-displayWeather` and their different states (`input-available`, `output-available`, `output-error`).

This approach allows you to dynamically render UI components based on the model's responses, creating a more interactive and context-aware chat experience.

## Expanding Your Generative UI Application

You can enhance your chat application by adding more tools and components, creating a richer and more versatile user experience. Here's how you can expand your application:

### Adding More Tools

To add more tools, simply define them in your `ai/tools.ts` file:

```ts
// Add a new stock tool
export const stockTool = createTool({
  description: 'Get price for a stock',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    symbol: z.string().describe('The stock symbol to get the price for'),
  }),
  execute: async function ({ symbol }) {
    // Simulated API call
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
    return { symbol, price: 100 };
  },
});

// Update the tools object
export const tools = {
  displayWeather: weatherTool,
  getStockPrice: stockTool,
};
```

Now, create a new file called `components/stock.tsx`:

```tsx
type StockProps = {
  price: number;
  symbol: string;
};

export const Stock = ({ price, symbol }: StockProps) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Stock Information</h2>
      <p>Symbol: {symbol}</p>
      <p>Price: ${price}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Finally, update your `page.tsx` file to include the new Stock component:

```tsx
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Weather } from '@/components/weather';
import { Stock } from '@/components/stock';

export default function Page() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat();

  const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    sendMessage({ text: input });
    setInput('');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {messages.map((message) => (
        <div key={message.id}>
          <div>{message.role}</div>
          <div>
            {message.parts.map((part, index) => {
              if (part.type === 'text') {
                return <span key={index}>{part.text}</span>;
              }

              if (part.type === 'tool-displayWeather') {
                switch (part.state) {
                  case 'input-available':
                    return <div key={index}>Loading weather...</div>;
                  case 'output-available':
                    return (
                      <div key={index}>
                        <Weather {...part.output} />
                      </div>
                    );
                  case 'output-error':
                    return <div key={index}>Error: {part.errorText}</div>;
                  default:
                    return null;
                }
              }

              if (part.type === 'tool-getStockPrice') {
                switch (part.state) {
                  case 'input-available':
                    return <div key={index}>Loading stock price...</div>;
                  case 'output-available':
                    return (
                      <div key={index}>
                        <Stock {...part.output} />
                      </div>
                    );
                  case 'output-error':
                    return <div key={index}>Error: {part.errorText}</div>;
                  default:
                    return null;
                }
              }

              return null;
            })}
          </div>
        </div>
      ))}

      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          type="text"
          value={input}
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

By following this pattern, you can continue to add more tools and components, expanding the capabilities of your Generative UI application.

description: Learn how to use the useCompletion hook.

# Completion

The `useCompletion` hook allows you to create a user interface to handle text completions in your application. It enables the streaming of text completions from your AI provider, manages the state for chat input, and updates the UI automatically as new messages are received.

<Note>
  The `useCompletion` hook is now part of the `@ai-sdk/react` package.
</Note>

In this guide, you will learn how to use the `useCompletion` hook in your application to generate text completions and stream them in real-time to your users.

## Example

```tsx filename='app/page.tsx'
'use client';

import { useCompletion } from '@ai-sdk/react';

export default function Page() {
  const { completion, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useCompletion({
    api: '/api/completion',
  });

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input
        name="prompt"
        value={input}
        onChange={handleInputChange}
        id="input"
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      <div>{completion}</div>
    </form>
  );
}
```

```ts filename='app/api/completion/route.ts'
import { streamText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

// Allow streaming responses up to 30 seconds
export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { prompt }: { prompt: string } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    prompt,
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

In the `Page` component, the `useCompletion` hook will request to your AI provider endpoint whenever the user submits a message. The completion is then streamed back in real-time and displayed in the UI.

This enables a seamless text completion experience where the user can see the AI response as soon as it is available, without having to wait for the entire response to be received.

## Customized UI

`useCompletion` also provides ways to manage the prompt via code, show loading and error states, and update messages without being triggered by user interactions.

### Loading and error states

To show a loading spinner while the chatbot is processing the user's message, you can use the `isLoading` state returned by the `useCompletion` hook:

```tsx
const { isLoading, ... } = useCompletion()

return(
  <>
    {isLoading ? <Spinner /> : null}
  </>
)
```

Similarly, the `error` state reflects the error object thrown during the fetch request. It can be used to display an error message, or show a toast notification:

```tsx
const { error, ... } = useCompletion()

useEffect(() => {
  if (error) {
    toast.error(error.message)
  }
}, [error])

// Or display the error message in the UI:
return (
  <>
    {error ? <div>{error.message}</div> : null}
  </>
)
```

### Controlled input

In the initial example, we have `handleSubmit` and `handleInputChange` callbacks that manage the input changes and form submissions. These are handy for common use cases, but you can also use uncontrolled APIs for more advanced scenarios such as form validation or customized components.

The following example demonstrates how to use more granular APIs like `setInput` with your custom input and submit button components:

```tsx
const { input, setInput } = useCompletion();

return (
  <>
    <MyCustomInput value={input} onChange={(value) => setInput(value)} />
  </>
);
```

### Cancelation

It's also a common use case to abort the response message while it's still streaming back from the AI provider. You can do this by calling the `stop` function returned by the `useCompletion` hook.

```tsx
const { stop, isLoading, ... } = useCompletion()

return (
  <>
    <button onClick={stop} disabled={!isLoading}>Stop</button>
  </>
)
```

When the user clicks the "Stop" button, the fetch request will be aborted. This avoids consuming unnecessary resources and improves the UX of your application.

### Throttling UI Updates

<Note>This feature is currently only available for React.</Note>

By default, the `useCompletion` hook will trigger a render every time a new chunk is received.
You can throttle the UI updates with the `experimental_throttle` option.

```tsx filename="page.tsx" highlight="2-3"
const { completion, ... } = useCompletion({
  // Throttle the completion and data updates to 50ms:
  experimental_throttle: 50
})
```

## Event Callbacks

`useCompletion` also provides optional event callbacks that you can use to handle different stages of the chatbot lifecycle. These callbacks can be used to trigger additional actions, such as logging, analytics, or custom UI updates.

```tsx
const { ... } = useCompletion({
  onResponse: (response: Response) => {
    console.log('Received response from server:', response)
  },
  onFinish: (prompt: string, completion: string) => {
    console.log('Finished streaming completion:', completion)
  },
  onError: (error: Error) => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', error)
  },
})
```

It's worth noting that you can abort the processing by throwing an error in the `onResponse` callback. This will trigger the `onError` callback and stop the message from being appended to the chat UI. This can be useful for handling unexpected responses from the AI provider.

## Configure Request Options

By default, the `useCompletion` hook sends a HTTP POST request to the `/api/completion` endpoint with the prompt as part of the request body. You can customize the request by passing additional options to the `useCompletion` hook:

```tsx
const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useCompletion({
  api: '/api/custom-completion',
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'your_token',
  },
  body: {
    user_id: '123',
  },
  credentials: 'same-origin',
});
```

In this example, the `useCompletion` hook sends a POST request to the `/api/completion` endpoint with the specified headers, additional body fields, and credentials for that fetch request. On your server side, you can handle the request with these additional information.

# Object Generation

<Note>
  `useObject` is an experimental feature and only available in React, Svelte,
  and Vue.
</Note>

The [`useObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-object) hook allows you to create interfaces that represent a structured JSON object that is being streamed.

In this guide, you will learn how to use the `useObject` hook in your application to generate UIs for structured data on the fly.

## Example

The example shows a small notifications demo app that generates fake notifications in real-time.

### Schema

It is helpful to set up the schema in a separate file that is imported on both the client and server.

```ts filename='app/api/notifications/schema.ts'
import { z } from 'zod';

// define a schema for the notifications
export const notificationSchema = z.object({
  notifications: z.array(
    z.object({
      name: z.string().describe('Name of a fictional person.'),
      message: z.string().describe('Message. Do not use emojis or links.'),
    })
  ),
});
```

### Client

The client uses [`useObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-object) to stream the object generation process.

The results are partial and are displayed as they are received.
Please note the code for handling `undefined` values in the JSX.

```tsx filename='app/page.tsx'
'use client';

import { experimental_useObject as useObject } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { notificationSchema } from './api/notifications/schema';

export default function Page() {
  const { object, submit } = useObject({
    api: '/api/notifications',
    schema: notificationSchema,
  });

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => submit('Messages during finals week.')}>
        Generate notifications
      </button>

      {object?.notifications?.map((notification, index) => (
        <div key={index}>
          <p>{notification?.name}</p>
          <p>{notification?.message}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </>
  );
}
```

### Server

On the server, we use [`streamObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-object) to stream the object generation process.

```typescript filename='app/api/notifications/route.ts'
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { streamObject } from 'ai';
import { notificationSchema } from './schema';

// Allow streaming responses up to 30 seconds
export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const context = await req.json();

  const result = streamObject({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    schema: notificationSchema,
    prompt:
      `Generate 3 notifications for a messages app in this context:` + context,
  });

  return result.toTextStreamResponse();
}
```

## Enum Output Mode

When you need to classify or categorize input into predefined options, you can use the `enum` output mode with `useObject`. This requires a specific schema structure where the object has `enum` as a key with `z.enum` containing your possible values.

### Example: Text Classification

This example shows how to build a simple text classifier that categorizes statements as true or false.

#### Client

When using `useObject` with enum output mode, your schema must be an object with `enum` as the key:

```tsx filename='app/classify/page.tsx'
'use client';

import { experimental_useObject as useObject } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { z } from 'zod';

export default function ClassifyPage() {
  const { object, submit, isLoading } = useObject({
    api: '/api/classify',
    schema: z.object({ enum: z.enum(['true', 'false']) }),
  });

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => submit('The earth is flat')} disabled={isLoading}>
        Classify statement
      </button>

      {object && <div>Classification: {object.enum}</div>}
    </>
  );
}
```

#### Server

On the server, use `streamObject` with `output: 'enum'` to stream the classification result:

```typescript filename='app/api/classify/route.ts'
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { streamObject } from 'ai';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const context = await req.json();

  const result = streamObject({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    output: 'enum',
    enum: ['true', 'false'],
    prompt: `Classify this statement as true or false: ${context}`,
  });

  return result.toTextStreamResponse();
}
```

## Customized UI

`useObject` also provides ways to show loading and error states:

### Loading State

The `isLoading` state returned by the `useObject` hook can be used for several
purposes:

- To show a loading spinner while the object is generated.
- To disable the submit button.

```tsx filename='app/page.tsx' highlight="6,13-20,24"
'use client';

import { useObject } from '@ai-sdk/react';

export default function Page() {
  const { isLoading, object, submit } = useObject({
    api: '/api/notifications',
    schema: notificationSchema,
  });

  return (
    <>
      {isLoading && <Spinner />}

      <button
        onClick={() => submit('Messages during finals week.')}
        disabled={isLoading}
      >
        Generate notifications
      </button>

      {object?.notifications?.map((notification, index) => (
        <div key={index}>
          <p>{notification?.name}</p>
          <p>{notification?.message}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </>
  );
}
```

### Stop Handler

The `stop` function can be used to stop the object generation process. This can be useful if the user wants to cancel the request or if the server is taking too long to respond.

```tsx filename='app/page.tsx' highlight="6,14-16"
'use client';

import { useObject } from '@ai-sdk/react';

export default function Page() {
  const { isLoading, stop, object, submit } = useObject({
    api: '/api/notifications',
    schema: notificationSchema,
  });

  return (
    <>
      {isLoading && (
        <button type="button" onClick={() => stop()}>
          Stop
        </button>
      )}

      <button onClick={() => submit('Messages during finals week.')}>
        Generate notifications
      </button>

      {object?.notifications?.map((notification, index) => (
        <div key={index}>
          <p>{notification?.name}</p>
          <p>{notification?.message}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </>
  );
}
```

### Error State

Similarly, the `error` state reflects the error object thrown during the fetch request.
It can be used to display an error message, or to disable the submit button:

<Note>
  We recommend showing a generic error message to the user, such as "Something
  went wrong." This is a good practice to avoid leaking information from the
  server.
</Note>

```tsx file="app/page.tsx" highlight="6,13"
'use client';

import { useObject } from '@ai-sdk/react';

export default function Page() {
  const { error, object, submit } = useObject({
    api: '/api/notifications',
    schema: notificationSchema,
  });

  return (
    <>
      {error && <div>An error occurred.</div>}

      <button onClick={() => submit('Messages during finals week.')}>
        Generate notifications
      </button>

      {object?.notifications?.map((notification, index) => (
        <div key={index}>
          <p>{notification?.name}</p>
          <p>{notification?.message}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </>
  );
}
```

## Event Callbacks

`useObject` provides optional event callbacks that you can use to handle life-cycle events.

- `onFinish`: Called when the object generation is completed.
- `onError`: Called when an error occurs during the fetch request.

These callbacks can be used to trigger additional actions, such as logging, analytics, or custom UI updates.

```tsx filename='app/page.tsx' highlight="10-20"
'use client';

import { experimental_useObject as useObject } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { notificationSchema } from './api/notifications/schema';

export default function Page() {
  const { object, submit } = useObject({
    api: '/api/notifications',
    schema: notificationSchema,
    onFinish({ object, error }) {
      // typed object, undefined if schema validation fails:
      console.log('Object generation completed:', object);

      // error, undefined if schema validation succeeds:
      console.log('Schema validation error:', error);
    },
    onError(error) {
      // error during fetch request:
      console.error('An error occurred:', error);
    },
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => submit('Messages during finals week.')}>
        Generate notifications
      </button>

      {object?.notifications?.map((notification, index) => (
        <div key={index}>
          <p>{notification?.name}</p>
          <p>{notification?.message}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Configure Request Options

You can configure the API endpoint, optional headers and credentials using the `api`, `headers` and `credentials` settings.

```tsx highlight="2-5"
const { submit, object } = useObject({
  api: '/api/use-object',
  headers: {
    'X-Custom-Header': 'CustomValue',
  },
  credentials: 'include',
  schema: yourSchema,
});
```

title: Streaming Custom Data
description: Learn how to stream custom data from the server to the client.

---

# Streaming Custom Data

It is often useful to send additional data alongside the model's response.
For example, you may want to send status information, the message ids after storing them,
or references to content that the language model is referring to.

The AI SDK provides several helpers that allows you to stream additional data to the client
and attach it to the `UIMessage` parts array:

- `createUIMessageStream`: creates a data stream
- `createUIMessageStreamResponse`: creates a response object that streams data
- `pipeUIMessageStreamToResponse`: pipes a data stream to a server response object

The data is streamed as part of the response stream using Server-Sent Events.

## Setting Up Type-Safe Data Streaming

First, define your custom message type with data part schemas for type safety:

```tsx filename="ai/types.ts"
import { UIMessage } from 'ai';

// Define your custom message type with data part schemas
export type MyUIMessage = UIMessage<
  never, // metadata type
  {
    weather: {
      city: string;
      weather?: string;
      status: 'loading' | 'success';
    };
    notification: {
      message: string;
      level: 'info' | 'warning' | 'error';
    };
  } // data parts type
>;
```

## Streaming Data from the Server

In your server-side route handler, you can create a `UIMessageStream` and then pass it to `createUIMessageStreamResponse`:

```tsx filename="route.ts"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import {
  createUIMessageStream,
  createUIMessageStreamResponse,
  streamText,
  convertToModelMessages,
} from 'ai';
import type { MyUIMessage } from '@/ai/types';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();

  const stream = createUIMessageStream<MyUIMessage>({
    execute: ({ writer }) => {
      // 1. Send initial status (transient - won't be added to message history)
      writer.write({
        type: 'data-notification',
        data: { message: 'Processing your request...', level: 'info' },
        transient: true, // This part won't be added to message history
      });

      // 2. Send sources (useful for RAG use cases)
      writer.write({
        type: 'source',
        value: {
          type: 'source',
          sourceType: 'url',
          id: 'source-1',
          url: 'https://weather.com',
          title: 'Weather Data Source',
        },
      });

      // 3. Send data parts with loading state
      writer.write({
        type: 'data-weather',
        id: 'weather-1',
        data: { city: 'San Francisco', status: 'loading' },
      });

      const result = streamText({
        model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
        messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
        onFinish() {
          // 4. Update the same data part (reconciliation)
          writer.write({
            type: 'data-weather',
            id: 'weather-1', // Same ID = update existing part
            data: {
              city: 'San Francisco',
              weather: 'sunny',
              status: 'success',
            },
          });

          // 5. Send completion notification (transient)
          writer.write({
            type: 'data-notification',
            data: { message: 'Request completed', level: 'info' },
            transient: true, // Won't be added to message history
          });
        },
      });

      writer.merge(result.toUIMessageStream());
    },
  });

  return createUIMessageStreamResponse({ stream });
}
```

<Note>
  You can also send stream data from custom backends, e.g. Python / FastAPI,
  using the [UI Message Stream
  Protocol](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/stream-protocol#ui-message-stream-protocol).
</Note>

## Types of Streamable Data

### Data Parts (Persistent)

Regular data parts are added to the message history and appear in `message.parts`:

```tsx
writer.write({
  type: 'data-weather',
  id: 'weather-1', // Optional: enables reconciliation
  data: { city: 'San Francisco', status: 'loading' },
});
```

### Sources

Sources are useful for RAG implementations where you want to show which documents or URLs were referenced:

```tsx
writer.write({
  type: 'source',
  value: {
    type: 'source',
    sourceType: 'url',
    id: 'source-1',
    url: 'https://example.com',
    title: 'Example Source',
  },
});
```

### Transient Data Parts (Ephemeral)

Transient parts are sent to the client but not added to the message history. They are only accessible via the `onData` useChat handler:

```tsx
// server
writer.write({
  type: 'data-notification',
  data: { message: 'Processing...', level: 'info' },
  transient: true, // Won't be added to message history
});

// client
const [notification, setNotification] = useState();

const { messages } = useChat({
  onData: ({ data, type }) => {
    if (type === 'data-notification') {
      setNotification({ message: data.message, level: data.level });
    }
  },
});
```

## Data Part Reconciliation

When you write to a data part with the same ID, the client automatically reconciles and updates that part. This enables powerful dynamic experiences like:

- **Collaborative artifacts** - Update code, documents, or designs in real-time
- **Progressive data loading** - Show loading states that transform into final results
- **Live status updates** - Update progress bars, counters, or status indicators
- **Interactive components** - Build UI elements that evolve based on user interaction

The reconciliation happens automatically - simply use the same `id` when writing to the stream.

## Processing Data on the Client

### Using the onData Callback

The `onData` callback is essential for handling streaming data, especially transient parts:

```tsx filename="page.tsx"
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import type { MyUIMessage } from '@/ai/types';

const { messages } = useChat<MyUIMessage>({
  api: '/api/chat',
  onData: (dataPart) => {
    // Handle all data parts as they arrive (including transient parts)
    console.log('Received data part:', dataPart);

    // Handle different data part types
    if (dataPart.type === 'data-weather') {
      console.log('Weather update:', dataPart.data);
    }

    // Handle transient notifications (ONLY available here, not in message.parts)
    if (dataPart.type === 'data-notification') {
      showToast(dataPart.data.message, dataPart.data.level);
    }
  },
});
```

**Important:** Transient data parts are **only** available through the `onData` callback. They will not appear in the `message.parts` array since they're not added to message history.

### Rendering Persistent Data Parts

You can filter and render data parts from the message parts array:

```tsx filename="page.tsx"
const result = (
  <>
    {messages?.map((message) => (
      <div key={message.id}>
        {/* Render weather data parts */}
        {message.parts
          .filter((part) => part.type === 'data-weather')
          .map((part, index) => (
            <div key={index} className="weather-widget">
              {part.data.status === 'loading' ? (
                <>Getting weather for {part.data.city}...</>
              ) : (
                <>
                  Weather in {part.data.city}: {part.data.weather}
                </>
              )}
            </div>
          ))}

        {/* Render text content */}
        {message.parts
          .filter((part) => part.type === 'text')
          .map((part, index) => (
            <div key={index}>{part.text}</div>
          ))}

        {/* Render sources */}
        {message.parts
          .filter((part) => part.type === 'source')
          .map((part, index) => (
            <div key={index} className="source">
              Source: <a href={part.url}>{part.title}</a>
            </div>
          ))}
      </div>
    ))}
  </>
);
```

### Complete Example

```tsx filename="page.tsx"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { useState } from 'react';
import type { MyUIMessage } from '@/ai/types';

export default function Chat() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');

  const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat<MyUIMessage>({
    api: '/api/chat',
    onData: (dataPart) => {
      // Handle transient notifications
      if (dataPart.type === 'data-notification') {
        console.log('Notification:', dataPart.data.message);
      }
    },
  });

  const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    sendMessage({ text: input });
    setInput('');
  };

  return (
    <>
      {messages?.map((message) => (
        <div key={message.id}>
          {message.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}

          {/* Render weather data */}
          {message.parts
            .filter((part) => part.type === 'data-weather')
            .map((part, index) => (
              <span key={index} className="weather-update">
                {part.data.status === 'loading' ? (
                  <>Getting weather for {part.data.city}...</>
                ) : (
                  <>
                    Weather in {part.data.city}: {part.data.weather}
                  </>
                )}
              </span>
            ))}

          {/* Render text content */}
          {message.parts
            .filter((part) => part.type === 'text')
            .map((part, index) => (
              <div key={index}>{part.text}</div>
            ))}
        </div>
      ))}

      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          value={input}
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Ask about the weather..."
        />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Use Cases

- **RAG Applications** - Stream sources and retrieved documents
- **Real-time Status** - Show loading states and progress updates
- **Collaborative Tools** - Stream live updates to shared artifacts
- **Analytics** - Send usage data without cluttering message history
- **Notifications** - Display temporary alerts and status messages

## Message Metadata vs Data Parts

Both [message metadata](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/message-metadata) and data parts allow you to send additional information alongside messages, but they serve different purposes:

### Message Metadata

Message metadata is best for **message-level information** that describes the message as a whole:

- Attached at the message level via `message.metadata`
- Sent using the `messageMetadata` callback in `toUIMessageStreamResponse`
- Ideal for: timestamps, model info, token usage, user context
- Type-safe with custom metadata types

```ts
// Server: Send metadata about the message
return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse({
  messageMetadata: ({ part }) => {
    if (part.type === 'finish') {
      return {
        model: part.response.modelId,
        totalTokens: part.totalUsage.totalTokens,
        createdAt: Date.now(),
      };
    }
  },
});
```

### Data Parts

Data parts are best for streaming **dynamic arbitrary data**:

- Added to the message parts array via `message.parts`
- Streamed using `createUIMessageStream` and `writer.write()`
- Can be reconciled/updated using the same ID
- Support transient parts that don't persist
- Ideal for: dynamic content, loading states, interactive components

```ts
// Server: Stream data as part of message content
writer.write({
  type: 'data-weather',
  id: 'weather-1',
  data: { city: 'San Francisco', status: 'loading' },
});
```

For more details on message metadata, see the [Message Metadata documentation](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/message-metadata).

title: Error Handling
description: Learn how to handle errors in the AI SDK UI

---

# Error Handling and warnings

## Warnings

The AI SDK shows warnings when something might not work as expected. These warnings help you fix problems before they cause errors.

### When Warnings Appear

Warnings are shown in the browser console when:

- **Unsupported settings**: You use a setting that the AI model doesn't support
- **Unsupported tools**: You use a tool that the AI model can't use
- **Other issues**: The AI model reports other problems

### Warning Messages

All warnings start with "AI SDK Warning:" so you can easily find them. For example:

```
AI SDK Warning: The "temperature" setting is not supported by this model
AI SDK Warning: The tool "calculator" is not supported by this model
```

### Turning Off Warnings

By default, warnings are shown in the console. You can control this behavior:

#### Turn Off All Warnings

Set a global variable to turn off warnings completely:

```ts
globalThis.AI_SDK_LOG_WARNINGS = false;
```

#### Custom Warning Handler

You can also provide your own function to handle warnings:

```ts
globalThis.AI_SDK_LOG_WARNINGS = (warnings) => {
  // Handle warnings your own way
  warnings.forEach((warning) => {
    // Your custom logic here
    console.log('Custom warning:', warning);
  });
};
```

<Note>
  Custom warning functions are experimental and can change in patch releases
  without notice.
</Note>

## Error Handling

### Error Helper Object

Each AI SDK UI hook also returns an [error](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat#error) object that you can use to render the error in your UI.
You can use the error object to show an error message, disable the submit button, or show a retry button.

<Note>
  We recommend showing a generic error message to the user, such as "Something
  went wrong." This is a good practice to avoid leaking information from the
  server.
</Note>

```tsx file="app/page.tsx" highlight="7,18-25,31"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Chat() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const { messages, sendMessage, error, regenerate } = useChat();

  const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    sendMessage({ text: input });
    setInput('');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {messages.map((m) => (
        <div key={m.id}>
          {m.role}:{' '}
          {m.parts
            .filter((part) => part.type === 'text')
            .map((part) => part.text)
            .join('')}
        </div>
      ))}

      {error && (
        <>
          <div>An error occurred.</div>
          <button type="button" onClick={() => regenerate()}>
            Retry
          </button>
        </>
      )}

      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          value={input}
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
          disabled={error != null}
        />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Alternative: replace last message

Alternatively you can write a custom submit handler that replaces the last message when an error is present.

```tsx file="app/page.tsx" highlight="17-23,35"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Chat() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const { sendMessage, error, messages, setMessages } = useChat();

  function customSubmit(event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
    event.preventDefault();

    if (error != null) {
      setMessages(messages.slice(0, -1)); // remove last message
    }

    sendMessage({ text: input });
    setInput('');
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {messages.map((m) => (
        <div key={m.id}>
          {m.role}:{' '}
          {m.parts
            .filter((part) => part.type === 'text')
            .map((part) => part.text)
            .join('')}
        </div>
      ))}

      {error && <div>An error occurred.</div>}

      <form onSubmit={customSubmit}>
        <input value={input} onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)} />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Error Handling Callback

Errors can be processed by passing an [`onError`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat#on-error) callback function as an option to the [`useChat`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat) or [`useCompletion`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-completion) hooks.
The callback function receives an error object as an argument.

```tsx file="app/page.tsx" highlight="6-9"
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';

export default function Page() {
  const {
    /* ... */
  } = useChat({
    // handle error:
    onError: (error) => {
      console.error(error);
    },
  });
}
```

### Injecting Errors for Testing

You might want to create errors for testing.
You can easily do so by throwing an error in your route handler:

```ts file="app/api/chat/route.ts"
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  throw new Error('This is a test error');
}
```

title: Transport
description: Learn how to use custom transports with useChat.

---

# Transport

The `useChat` transport system provides fine-grained control over how messages are sent to your API endpoints and how responses are processed. This is particularly useful for alternative communication protocols like WebSockets, custom authentication patterns, or specialized backend integrations.

## Default Transport

By default, `useChat` uses HTTP POST requests to send messages to `/api/chat`:

```tsx
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';

// Uses default HTTP transport
const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat();
```

This is equivalent to:

```tsx
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { DefaultChatTransport } from 'ai';

const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat({
  transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
    api: '/api/chat',
  }),
});
```

## Custom Transport Configuration

Configure the default transport with custom options:

```tsx
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { DefaultChatTransport } from 'ai';

const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat({
  transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
    api: '/api/custom-chat',
    headers: {
      Authorization: 'Bearer your-token',
      'X-API-Version': '2024-01',
    },
    credentials: 'include',
  }),
});
```

### Dynamic Configuration

You can also provide functions that return configuration values. This is useful for authentication tokens that need to be refreshed, or for configuration that depends on runtime conditions:

```tsx
const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat({
  transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
    api: '/api/chat',
    headers: () => ({
      Authorization: `Bearer ${getAuthToken()}`,
      'X-User-ID': getCurrentUserId(),
    }),
    body: () => ({
      sessionId: getCurrentSessionId(),
      preferences: getUserPreferences(),
    }),
    credentials: () => 'include',
  }),
});
```

### Request Transformation

Transform requests before sending to your API:

```tsx
const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat({
  transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
    api: '/api/chat',
    prepareSendMessagesRequest: ({ id, messages, trigger, messageId }) => {
      return {
        headers: {
          'X-Session-ID': id,
        },
        body: {
          messages: messages.slice(-10), // Only send last 10 messages
          trigger,
          messageId,
        },
      };
    },
  }),
});
```

## Building Custom Transports

To understand how to build your own transport, refer to the source code of the default implementation:

- **[DefaultChatTransport](https://github.com/vercel/ai/blob/main/packages/ai/src/ui/default-chat-transport.ts)** - The complete default HTTP transport implementation
- **[HttpChatTransport](https://github.com/vercel/ai/blob/main/packages/ai/src/ui/http-chat-transport.ts)** - Base HTTP transport with request handling
- **[ChatTransport Interface](https://github.com/vercel/ai/blob/main/packages/ai/src/ui/chat-transport.ts)** - The transport interface you need to implement

These implementations show you exactly how to:

- Handle the `sendMessages` method
- Process UI message streams
- Transform requests and responses
- Handle errors and connection management

The transport system gives you complete control over how your chat application communicates, enabling integration with any backend protocol or service.

title: Reading UIMessage Streams
description: Learn how to read UIMessage streams.

---

# Reading UI Message Streams

`UIMessage` streams are useful outside of traditional chat use cases. You can consume them for terminal UIs, custom stream processing on the client, or React Server Components (RSC).

The `readUIMessageStream` helper transforms a stream of `UIMessageChunk` objects into an `AsyncIterableStream` of `UIMessage` objects, allowing you to process messages as they're being constructed.

## Basic Usage

```tsx
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { readUIMessageStream, streamText } from 'ai';

async function main() {
  const result = streamText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    prompt: 'Write a short story about a robot.',
  });

  for await (const uiMessage of readUIMessageStream({
    stream: result.toUIMessageStream(),
  })) {
    console.log('Current message state:', uiMessage);
  }
}
```

## Tool Calls Integration

Handle streaming responses that include tool calls:

```tsx
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { readUIMessageStream, streamText, tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

async function handleToolCalls() {
  const result = streamText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    tools: {
      weather: tool({
        description: 'Get the weather in a location',
        inputSchema: z.object({
          location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
        }),
        execute: ({ location }) => ({
          location,
          temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
        }),
      }),
    },
    prompt: 'What is the weather in Tokyo?',
  });

  for await (const uiMessage of readUIMessageStream({
    stream: result.toUIMessageStream(),
  })) {
    // Handle different part types
    uiMessage.parts.forEach((part) => {
      switch (part.type) {
        case 'text':
          console.log('Text:', part.text);
          break;
        case 'tool-call':
          console.log('Tool called:', part.toolName, 'with args:', part.args);
          break;
        case 'tool-result':
          console.log('Tool result:', part.result);
          break;
      }
    });
  }
}
```

## Resuming Conversations

Resume streaming from a previous message state:

```tsx
import { readUIMessageStream, streamText } from 'ai';

async function resumeConversation(lastMessage: UIMessage) {
  const result = streamText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    messages: [
      { role: 'user', content: 'Continue our previous conversation.' },
    ],
  });

  // Resume from the last message
  for await (const uiMessage of readUIMessageStream({
    stream: result.toUIMessageStream(),
    message: lastMessage, // Resume from this message
  })) {
    console.log('Resumed message:', uiMessage);
  }
}
```

title: Message Metadata
description: Learn how to attach and use metadata with messages in AI SDK UI

---

# Message Metadata

Message metadata allows you to attach custom information to messages at the message level. This is useful for tracking timestamps, model information, token usage, user context, and other message-level data.

## Overview

Message metadata differs from [data parts](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/streaming-data) in that it's attached at the message level rather than being part of the message content. While data parts are ideal for dynamic content that forms part of the message, metadata is perfect for information about the message itself.

## Getting Started

Here's a simple example of using message metadata to track timestamps and model information:

### Defining Metadata Types

First, define your metadata type for type safety:

```tsx filename="app/types.ts"
import { UIMessage } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

// Define your metadata schema
export const messageMetadataSchema = z.object({
  createdAt: z.number().optional(),
  model: z.string().optional(),
  totalTokens: z.number().optional(),
});

export type MessageMetadata = z.infer<typeof messageMetadataSchema>;

// Create a typed UIMessage
export type MyUIMessage = UIMessage<MessageMetadata>;
```

### Sending Metadata from the Server

Use the `messageMetadata` callback in `toUIMessageStreamResponse` to send metadata at different streaming stages:

```ts filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" highlight="11-20"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { convertToModelMessages, streamText } from 'ai';
import type { MyUIMessage } from '@/types';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: MyUIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse({
    originalMessages: messages, // pass this in for type-safe return objects
    messageMetadata: ({ part }) => {
      // Send metadata when streaming starts
      if (part.type === 'start') {
        return {
          createdAt: Date.now(),
          model: 'gpt-5.1',
        };
      }

      // Send additional metadata when streaming completes
      if (part.type === 'finish') {
        return {
          totalTokens: part.totalUsage.totalTokens,
        };
      }
    },
  });
}
```

<Note>
  To enable type-safe metadata return object in `messageMetadata`, pass in the
  `originalMessages` parameter typed to your UIMessage type.
</Note>

### Accessing Metadata on the Client

Access metadata through the `message.metadata` property:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" highlight="8,18-23"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import { DefaultChatTransport } from 'ai';
import type { MyUIMessage } from '@/types';

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages } = useChat<MyUIMessage>({
    transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
      api: '/api/chat',
    }),
  });

  return (
    <div>
      {messages.map((message) => (
        <div key={message.id}>
          <div>
            {message.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
            {message.metadata?.createdAt && (
              <span className="text-sm text-gray-500">
                {new Date(message.metadata.createdAt).toLocaleTimeString()}
              </span>
            )}
          </div>

          {/* Render message content */}
          {message.parts.map((part, index) =>
            part.type === 'text' ? <div key={index}>{part.text}</div> : null
          )}

          {/* Display additional metadata */}
          {message.metadata?.totalTokens && (
            <div className="text-xs text-gray-400">
              {message.metadata.totalTokens} tokens
            </div>
          )}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Note>
  For streaming arbitrary data that changes during generation, consider using
  [data parts](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/streaming-data) instead.
</Note>

## Common Use Cases

Message metadata is ideal for:

- **Timestamps**: When messages were created or completed
- **Model Information**: Which AI model was used
- **Token Usage**: Track costs and usage limits
- **User Context**: User IDs, session information
- **Performance Metrics**: Generation time, time to first token
- **Quality Indicators**: Finish reason, confidence scores

# AI Gateway Provider

The [AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway) provider connects you to models from multiple AI providers through a single interface. Instead of integrating with each provider separately, you can access OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, xAI, and other providers and their models.

## Features

- Access models from multiple providers without having to install additional provider modules/dependencies
- Use the same code structure across different AI providers
- Switch between models and providers easily
- Automatic authentication when deployed on Vercel
- View pricing information across providers
- Observability for AI model usage through the Vercel dashboard

## Setup

The Vercel AI Gateway provider is part of the AI SDK.

## Basic Usage

For most use cases, you can use the AI Gateway directly with a model string:

```ts
// use plain model string with global provider
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-5',
  prompt: 'Hello world',
});
```

```ts
// use provider instance (requires version 5.0.36 or later)
import { generateText, gateway } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: gateway('openai/gpt-5'),
  prompt: 'Hello world',
});
```

The AI SDK automatically uses the AI Gateway when you pass a model string in the `creator/model-name` format.

## Provider Instance

<Note>
  The `gateway` provider instance is available from the `ai` package in version
  5.0.36 and later.
</Note>

You can also import the default provider instance `gateway` from `ai`:

```ts
import { gateway } from 'ai';
```

You may want to create a custom provider instance when you need to:

- Set custom configuration options (API key, base URL, headers)
- Use the provider in a [provider registry](/docs/ai-sdk-core/provider-management)
- Wrap the provider with [middleware](/docs/ai-sdk-core/middleware)
- Use different settings for different parts of your application

To create a custom provider instance, import `createGateway` from `ai`:

```ts
import { createGateway } from 'ai';

const gateway = createGateway({
  apiKey: process.env.AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY ?? '',
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the AI Gateway provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls. The default prefix is `https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1/ai`.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header. It defaults to
  the `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  Defaults to the global `fetch` function.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

- **metadataCacheRefreshMillis** _number_

  How frequently to refresh the metadata cache in milliseconds. Defaults to 5 minutes (300,000ms).

## Authentication

The Gateway provider supports two authentication methods:

### API Key Authentication

Set your API key via environment variable:

```bash
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Or pass it directly to the provider:

```ts
import { createGateway } from 'ai';

const gateway = createGateway({
  apiKey: 'your_api_key_here',
});
```

### OIDC Authentication (Vercel Deployments)

When deployed to Vercel, the AI Gateway provider supports authenticating using [OIDC (OpenID Connect)
tokens](https://vercel.com/docs/oidc) without API Keys.

#### How OIDC Authentication Works

1. **In Production/Preview Deployments**:

   - OIDC authentication is automatically handled
   - No manual configuration needed
   - Tokens are automatically obtained and refreshed

2. **In Local Development**:
   - First, install and authenticate with the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli)
   - Run `vercel env pull` to download your project's OIDC token locally
   - For automatic token management:
     - Use `vercel dev` to start your development server - this will handle token refreshing automatically
   - For manual token management:
     - If not using `vercel dev`, note that OIDC tokens expire after 12 hours
     - You'll need to run `vercel env pull` again to refresh the token before it expires

<Note>
  If an API Key is present (either passed directly or via environment), it will
  always be used, even if invalid.
</Note>

Read more about using OIDC tokens in the [Vercel AI Gateway docs](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway#using-the-ai-gateway-with-a-vercel-oidc-token).

## Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)

You can connect your own provider credentials to use with Vercel AI Gateway. This lets you use your existing provider accounts and access private resources.

To set up BYOK, add your provider credentials in your Vercel team's AI Gateway settings. Once configured, AI Gateway automatically uses your credentials. No code changes are needed.

Learn more in the [BYOK documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/byok).

## Language Models

You can create language models using a provider instance. The first argument is the model ID in the format `creator/model-name`:

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-5',
  prompt: 'Explain quantum computing in simple terms',
});
```

AI Gateway language models can also be used in the `streamText`, `generateObject`, and `streamObject` functions (see [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core)).

## Available Models

The AI Gateway supports models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, xAI, Mistral, DeepSeek, Amazon Bedrock, Cohere, Perplexity, Alibaba, and other providers.

For the complete list of available models, see the [AI Gateway documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway).

## Dynamic Model Discovery

You can discover available models programmatically:

```ts
import { gateway, generateText } from 'ai';

const availableModels = await gateway.getAvailableModels();

// List all available models
availableModels.models.forEach((model) => {
  console.log(`${model.id}: ${model.name}`);
  if (model.description) {
    console.log(`  Description: ${model.description}`);
  }
  if (model.pricing) {
    console.log(`  Input: $${model.pricing.input}/token`);
    console.log(`  Output: $${model.pricing.output}/token`);
    if (model.pricing.cachedInputTokens) {
      console.log(
        `  Cached input (read): $${model.pricing.cachedInputTokens}/token`
      );
    }
    if (model.pricing.cacheCreationInputTokens) {
      console.log(
        `  Cache creation (write): $${model.pricing.cacheCreationInputTokens}/token`
      );
    }
  }
});

// Use any discovered model with plain string
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: availableModels.models[0].id, // e.g., 'openai/gpt-4o'
  prompt: 'Hello world',
});
```

## Credit Usage

You can check your team's current credit balance and usage:

```ts
import { gateway } from 'ai';

const credits = await gateway.getCredits();

console.log(`Team balance: ${credits.balance} credits`);
console.log(`Team total used: ${credits.total_used} credits`);
```

The `getCredits()` method returns your team's credit information based on the authenticated API key or OIDC token:

- **balance** _number_ - Your team's current available credit balance
- **total_used** _number_ - Total credits consumed by your team

## Examples

### Basic Text Generation

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4',
  prompt: 'Write a haiku about programming',
});

console.log(text);
```

### Streaming

```ts
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const { textStream } = await streamText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-5',
  prompt: 'Explain the benefits of serverless architecture',
});

for await (const textPart of textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(textPart);
}
```

### Tool Usage

```ts
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: 'xai/grok-4',
  prompt: 'What is the weather like in San Francisco?',
  tools: {
    getWeather: tool({
      description: 'Get the current weather for a location',
      parameters: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => {
        // Your weather API call here
        return `It's sunny in ${location}`;
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

### Provider-Executed Tools

Some providers offer tools that are executed by the provider itself, such as [OpenAI's web search tool](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/openai#web-search-tool). To use these tools through AI Gateway, import the provider to access the tool definitions:

```ts
import { generateText, stepCountIs } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-5-mini',
  prompt: 'What is the Vercel AI Gateway?',
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(10),
  tools: {
    web_search: openai.tools.webSearch({}),
  },
});

console.dir(result.text);
```

<Note>
  Some provider-executed tools require account-specific configuration (such as
  Claude Agent Skills) and may not work through AI Gateway. To use these tools,
  you must bring your own key (BYOK) directly to the provider.
</Note>

### Usage Tracking with User and Tags

Track usage per end-user and categorize requests with tags:

```ts
import type { GatewayProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/gateway';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-5',
  prompt: 'Summarize this document...',
  providerOptions: {
    gateway: {
      user: 'user-abc-123', // Track usage for this specific end-user
      tags: ['document-summary', 'premium-feature'], // Categorize for reporting
    } satisfies GatewayProviderOptions,
  },
});
```

This allows you to:

- View usage and costs broken down by end-user in your analytics
- Filter and analyze spending by feature or use case using tags
- Track which users or features are driving the most AI usage

## Provider Options

The AI Gateway provider accepts provider options that control routing behavior and provider-specific configurations.

### Gateway Provider Options

You can use the `gateway` key in `providerOptions` to control how AI Gateway routes requests:

```ts
import type { GatewayProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/gateway';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4',
  prompt: 'Explain quantum computing',
  providerOptions: {
    gateway: {
      order: ['vertex', 'anthropic'], // Try Vertex AI first, then Anthropic
      only: ['vertex', 'anthropic'], // Only use these providers
    } satisfies GatewayProviderOptions,
  },
});
```

The following gateway provider options are available:

- **order** _string[]_

  Specifies the sequence of providers to attempt when routing requests. The gateway will try providers in the order specified. If a provider fails or is unavailable, it will move to the next provider in the list.

  Example: `order: ['bedrock', 'anthropic']` will attempt Amazon Bedrock first, then fall back to Anthropic.

- **only** _string[]_

  Restricts routing to only the specified providers. When set, the gateway will never route to providers not in this list, even if they would otherwise be available.

  Example: `only: ['anthropic', 'vertex']` will only allow routing to Anthropic or Vertex AI.

- **models** _string[]_

  Specifies fallback models to use when the primary model fails or is unavailable. The gateway will try the primary model first (specified in the `model` parameter), then try each model in this array in order until one succeeds.

  Example: `models: ['openai/gpt-5-nano', 'gemini-2.0-flash']` will try the fallback models in order if the primary model fails.

- **user** _string_

  Optional identifier for the end user on whose behalf the request is being made. This is used for spend tracking and attribution purposes, allowing you to track usage per end-user in your application.

  Example: `user: 'user-123'` will associate this request with end-user ID "user-123" in usage reports.

- **tags** _string[]_

  Optional array of tags for categorizing and filtering usage in reports. Useful for tracking spend by feature, prompt version, or any other dimension relevant to your application.

  Example: `tags: ['chat', 'v2']` will tag this request with "chat" and "v2" for filtering in usage analytics.

You can combine these options to have fine-grained control over routing and tracking:

```ts
import type { GatewayProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/gateway';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4',
  prompt: 'Write a haiku about programming',
  providerOptions: {
    gateway: {
      order: ['vertex'], // Prefer Vertex AI
      only: ['anthropic', 'vertex'], // Only allow these providers
    } satisfies GatewayProviderOptions,
  },
});
```

#### Model Fallbacks Example

The `models` option enables automatic fallback to alternative models when the primary model fails:

```ts
import type { GatewayProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/gateway';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o', // Primary model
  prompt: 'Write a TypeScript haiku',
  providerOptions: {
    gateway: {
      models: ['openai/gpt-5-nano', 'gemini-2.0-flash'], // Fallback models
    } satisfies GatewayProviderOptions,
  },
});

// This will:
// 1. Try openai/gpt-4o first
// 2. If it fails, try openai/gpt-5-nano
// 3. If that fails, try gemini-2.0-flash
// 4. Return the result from the first model that succeeds
```

### Provider-Specific Options

When using provider-specific options through AI Gateway, use the actual provider name (e.g. `anthropic`, `openai`, not `gateway`) as the key:

```ts
import type { AnthropicProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import type { GatewayProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/gateway';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4',
  prompt: 'Explain quantum computing',
  providerOptions: {
    gateway: {
      order: ['vertex', 'anthropic'],
    } satisfies GatewayProviderOptions,
    anthropic: {
      thinking: { type: 'enabled', budgetTokens: 12000 },
    } satisfies AnthropicProviderOptions,
  },
});
```

This works with any provider supported by AI Gateway. Each provider has its own set of options - see the individual [provider documentation pages](/providers/ai-sdk-providers) for details on provider-specific options.

### Available Providers

AI Gateway supports routing to 20+ providers.

For a complete list of available providers and their slugs, see the [AI Gateway documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/provider-options#available-providers).

## Model Capabilities

Model capabilities depend on the specific provider and model you're using. For detailed capability information, see:

- [AI Gateway provider options](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/provider-options#available-providers) for an overview of available providers
- Individual [AI SDK provider pages](/providers/ai-sdk-providers) for specific model capabilities and features

# xAI Grok Provider

The [xAI Grok](https://x.ai) provider contains language model support for the [xAI API](https://x.ai/api).

## Setup

The xAI Grok provider is available via the `@ai-sdk/xai` module. You can
install it with

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/xai" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/xai" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/xai" dark />
</Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="bun add @ai-sdk/xai" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `xai` from `@ai-sdk/xai`:

```ts
import { xai } from '@ai-sdk/xai';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createXai` from `@ai-sdk/xai`
and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createXai } from '@ai-sdk/xai';

const xai = createXai({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the xAI provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls, e.g. to use proxy servers.
  The default prefix is `https://api.x.ai/v1`.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header. It defaults to
  the `XAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  Defaults to the global `fetch` function.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

## Language Models

You can create [xAI models](https://console.x.ai) using a provider instance. The
first argument is the model id, e.g. `grok-3`.

```ts
const model = xai('grok-3');
```

By default, `xai(modelId)` uses the Chat API. To use the Responses API with server-side agentic tools, explicitly use `xai.responses(modelId)`.

### Example

You can use xAI language models to generate text with the `generateText` function:

```ts
import { xai } from '@ai-sdk/xai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: xai('grok-3'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

xAI language models can also be used in the `streamText`, `generateObject`, and `streamObject` functions
(see [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core)).

### Provider Options

xAI chat models support additional provider options that are not part of
the [standard call settings](/docs/ai-sdk-core/settings). You can pass them in the `providerOptions` argument:

```ts
const model = xai('grok-3-mini');

await generateText({
  model,
  providerOptions: {
    xai: {
      reasoningEffort: 'high',
    },
  },
});
```

The following optional provider options are available for xAI chat models:

- **reasoningEffort** _'low' | 'medium' | 'high'_

  Reasoning effort for reasoning models.

- **store** _boolean_

  Whether to store the generation. Defaults to `true`.

- **previousResponseId** _string_

  The ID of the previous response. You can use it to continue a conversation. Defaults to `undefined`.

## Responses API (Agentic Tools)

You can use the xAI Responses API with the `xai.responses(modelId)` factory method for server-side agentic tool calling. This enables the model to autonomously orchestrate tool calls and research on xAI's servers.

```ts
const model = xai.responses('grok-4-fast');
```

The Responses API provides server-side tools that the model can autonomously execute during its reasoning process:

- **web_search**: Real-time web search and page browsing
- **x_search**: Search X (Twitter) posts, users, and threads
- **code_execution**: Execute Python code for calculations and data analysis

### Web Search Tool

The web search tool enables autonomous web research with optional domain filtering and image understanding:

```ts
import { xai } from '@ai-sdk/xai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, sources } = await generateText({
  model: xai.responses('grok-4-fast'),
  prompt: 'What are the latest developments in AI?',
  tools: {
    web_search: xai.tools.webSearch({
      allowedDomains: ['arxiv.org', 'openai.com'],
      enableImageUnderstanding: true,
    }),
  },
});

console.log(text);
console.log('Citations:', sources);
```

#### Web Search Parameters

- **allowedDomains** _string[]_

  Only search within specified domains (max 5). Cannot be used with `excludedDomains`.

- **excludedDomains** _string[]_

  Exclude specified domains from search (max 5). Cannot be used with `allowedDomains`.

- **enableImageUnderstanding** _boolean_

  Enable the model to view and analyze images found during search. Increases token usage.

### X Search Tool

The X search tool enables searching X (Twitter) for posts, with filtering by handles and date ranges:

```ts
const { text, sources } = await generateText({
  model: xai.responses('grok-4-fast'),
  prompt: 'What are people saying about AI on X this week?',
  tools: {
    x_search: xai.tools.xSearch({
      allowedXHandles: ['elonmusk', 'xai'],
      fromDate: '2025-10-23',
      toDate: '2025-10-30',
      enableImageUnderstanding: true,
      enableVideoUnderstanding: true,
    }),
  },
});
```

#### X Search Parameters

- **allowedXHandles** _string[]_

  Only search posts from specified X handles (max 10). Cannot be used with `excludedXHandles`.

- **excludedXHandles** _string[]_

  Exclude posts from specified X handles (max 10). Cannot be used with `allowedXHandles`.

- **fromDate** _string_

  Start date for posts in ISO8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD`).

- **toDate** _string_

  End date for posts in ISO8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD`).

- **enableImageUnderstanding** _boolean_

  Enable the model to view and analyze images in X posts.

- **enableVideoUnderstanding** _boolean_

  Enable the model to view and analyze videos in X posts.

### Code Execution Tool

The code execution tool enables the model to write and execute Python code for calculations and data analysis:

```ts
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: xai.responses('grok-4-fast'),
  prompt:
    'Calculate the compound interest for $10,000 at 5% annually for 10 years',
  tools: {
    code_execution: xai.tools.codeExecution(),
  },
});
```

### Multiple Tools

You can combine multiple server-side tools for comprehensive research:

```ts
import { xai } from '@ai-sdk/xai';
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const { fullStream } = streamText({
  model: xai.responses('grok-4-fast'),
  prompt: 'Research AI safety developments and calculate risk metrics',
  tools: {
    web_search: xai.tools.webSearch(),
    x_search: xai.tools.xSearch(),
    code_execution: xai.tools.codeExecution(),
  },
});

for await (const part of fullStream) {
  if (part.type === 'text-delta') {
    process.stdout.write(part.text);
  } else if (part.type === 'source' && part.sourceType === 'url') {
    console.log('\nSource:', part.url);
  }
}
```

### Provider Options

The Responses API supports the following provider options:

```ts
import { xai } from '@ai-sdk/xai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: xai.responses('grok-4-fast'),
  providerOptions: {
    xai: {
      reasoningEffort: 'high',
    },
  },
  // ...
});
```

The following provider options are available:

- **reasoningEffort** _'low' | 'high'_

  Control the reasoning effort for the model. Higher effort may produce more thorough results at the cost of increased latency and token usage.

<Note>
  The Responses API only supports server-side tools. You cannot mix server-side
  tools with client-side function tools in the same request.
</Note>

## Live Search

xAI models support Live Search functionality, allowing them to query real-time data from various sources and include it in responses with citations.

### Basic Search

To enable search, specify `searchParameters` with a search mode:

```ts
import { xai } from '@ai-sdk/xai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, sources } = await generateText({
  model: xai('grok-3-latest'),
  prompt: 'What are the latest developments in AI?',
  providerOptions: {
    xai: {
      searchParameters: {
        mode: 'auto', // 'auto', 'on', or 'off'
        returnCitations: true,
        maxSearchResults: 5,
      },
    },
  },
});

console.log(text);
console.log('Sources:', sources);
```

### Search Parameters

The following search parameters are available:

- **mode** _'auto' | 'on' | 'off'_

  Search mode preference:

  - `'auto'` (default): Model decides whether to search

        mode: 'on',
        returnCitations: true,
        maxSearchResults: 15,
        sources: [
          {
            type: 'web',
            allowedWebsites: ['arxiv.org', 'openai.com'],
          },
          {
            type: 'news',
            country: 'US',
          },

          },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Sources and Citations

When search is enabled with `returnCitations: true`, the response includes sources that were used to generate the answer:

```ts
const { text, sources } = await generateText({
  model: xai('grok-3-latest'),
  prompt: 'What are the latest developments in AI?',
  providerOptions: {
    xai: {
      searchParameters: {
        mode: 'auto',
        returnCitations: true,
      },
    },
  },
});

// Access the sources used
for (const source of sources) {
  if (source.sourceType === 'url') {
    console.log('Source:', source.url);
  }
}
```

### Streaming with Search

Live Search works with streaming responses. Citations are included when the stream completes:

```ts
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = streamText({
  model: xai('grok-3-latest'),
  prompt: 'What has happened in tech recently?',
  providerOptions: {
    xai: {
      searchParameters: {
        mode: 'auto',
        returnCitations: true,
      },
    },
  },
});

for await (const textPart of result.textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(textPart);
}

console.log('Sources:', await result.sources);
```

  docs](https://docs.x.ai/docs#models) for a full list of available models. The
  table above lists popular models. You can also pass any available provider
  model ID as a string if needed.
</Note>

## Image Models

You can create xAI image models using the `.image()` factory method. For more on image generation with the AI SDK see [generateImage()](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-image).

```ts
import { xai } from '@ai-sdk/xai';
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';

const { image } = await generateImage({
  model: xai.image('grok-2-image'),
  prompt: 'A futuristic cityscape at sunset',
});
```

<Note>
  The xAI image model does not currently support the `aspectRatio` or `size`
  parameters. Image size defaults to 1024x768.
</Note>

### Model-specific options

You can customize the image generation behavior with model-specific settings:

```ts
import { xai } from '@ai-sdk/xai';
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';

const { images } = await generateImage({
  model: xai.image('grok-2-image'),
  prompt: 'A futuristic cityscape at sunset',
  maxImagesPerCall: 5, // Default is 10
  n: 2, // Generate 2 images
});
```

- **Auto-fix**: Identifies and corrects common coding issues during generation
- **Quick edit**: Streams inline edits as they're available
- **Multimodal**: Supports both text and image inputs

## Setup

The Vercel provider is available via the `@ai-sdk/vercel` module. You can install it with:

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/vercel" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/vercel" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/vercel" dark />
</Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="bun add @ai-sdk/vercel" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `vercel` from `@ai-sdk/vercel`:

```ts
import { vercel } from '@ai-sdk/vercel';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createVercel` from `@ai-sdk/vercel` and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createVercel } from '@ai-sdk/vercel';

const vercel = createVercel({
  apiKey: process.env.VERCEL_API_KEY ?? '',
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the Vercel provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls. The default prefix is `https://api.v0.dev/v1`.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header. It defaults to
  the `VERCEL_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  Defaults to the global `fetch` function.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

## Language Models

You can create language models using a provider instance. The first argument is the model ID, for example:

```ts
import { vercel } from '@ai-sdk/vercel';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: vercel('v0-1.0-md'),
  prompt: 'Create a Next.js AI chatbot',
});
```

Vercel language models can also be used in the `streamText` function (see [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core)).

## Models

### v0-1.5-md

The `v0-1.5-md` model is for everyday tasks and UI generation.

### v0-1.5-lg

The `v0-1.5-lg` model is for advanced thinking or reasoning.

### v0-1.0-md (legacy)

The `v0-1.0-md` model is the legacy model served by the v0 API.

All v0 models have the following capabilities:

- Supports text and image inputs (multimodal)
- Supports function/tool calls
- Streaming responses with low latency
- Optimized for frontend and full-stack web development

## Model Capabilities

# OpenAI Provider

The [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) provider contains language model support for the OpenAI responses, chat, and completion APIs, as well as embedding model support for the OpenAI embeddings API.

## Setup

The OpenAI provider is available in the `@ai-sdk/openai` module. You can install it with

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/openai" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/openai" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/openai" dark />
</Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="bun add @ai-sdk/openai" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `openai` from `@ai-sdk/openai`:

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createOpenAI` from `@ai-sdk/openai` and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createOpenAI } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const openai = createOpenAI({
  // custom settings, e.g.
  headers: {
    'header-name': 'header-value',
  },
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the OpenAI provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls, e.g. to use proxy servers.
  The default prefix is `https://api.openai.com/v1`.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header.
  It defaults to the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **name** _string_

  The provider name. You can set this when using OpenAI compatible providers
  to change the model provider property. Defaults to `openai`.

- **organization** _string_

  OpenAI Organization.

- **project** _string_

  OpenAI project.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  Defaults to the global `fetch` function.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

## Language Models

The OpenAI provider instance is a function that you can invoke to create a language model:

```ts
const model = openai('gpt-5');
```

It automatically selects the correct API based on the model id.
You can also pass additional settings in the second argument:

```ts
const model = openai('gpt-5', {
  // additional settings
});
```

The available options depend on the API that's automatically chosen for the model (see below).
If you want to explicitly select a specific model API, you can use `.responses`, `.chat`, or `.completion`.

<Note>
  Since AI SDK 5, the OpenAI responses API is called by default (unless you
  specify e.g. 'openai.chat')
</Note>

### Example

You can use OpenAI language models to generate text with the `generateText` function:

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

OpenAI language models can also be used in the `streamText`, `generateObject`, and `streamObject` functions
(see [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core)).

### Responses Models

You can use the OpenAI responses API with the `openai(modelId)` or `openai.responses(modelId)` factory methods. It is the default API that is used by the OpenAI provider (since AI SDK 5).

```ts
const model = openai('gpt-5');
```

Further configuration can be done using OpenAI provider options.
You can validate the provider options using the `OpenAIResponsesProviderOptions` type.

```ts
import { openai, OpenAIResponsesProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5'), // or openai.responses('gpt-5')
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      parallelToolCalls: false,
      store: false,
      user: 'user_123',
      // ...
    } satisfies OpenAIResponsesProviderOptions,
  },
  // ...
});
```

The following provider options are available:

- **parallelToolCalls** _boolean_
  Whether to use parallel tool calls. Defaults to `true`.

- **store** _boolean_

  Whether to store the generation. Defaults to `true`.

- **maxToolCalls** _integer_
  The maximum number of total calls to built-in tools that can be processed in a response.
  This maximum number applies across all built-in tool calls, not per individual tool.
  Any further attempts to call a tool by the model will be ignored.

- **metadata** _Record&lt;string, string&gt;_
  Additional metadata to store with the generation.

- **conversation** _string_
  The ID of the OpenAI Conversation to continue.
  You must create a conversation first via the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/conversations/create).
  Cannot be used in conjunction with `previousResponseId`.
  Defaults to `undefined`.

- **previousResponseId** _string_
  The ID of the previous response. You can use it to continue a conversation. Defaults to `undefined`.

- **instructions** _string_
  Instructions for the model.
  They can be used to change the system or developer message when continuing a conversation using the `previousResponseId` option.
  Defaults to `undefined`.

- **user** _string_
  A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. Defaults to `undefined`.

- **reasoningEffort** _'none' | 'minimal' | 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'_
  Reasoning effort for reasoning models. Defaults to `medium`. If you use `providerOptions` to set the `reasoningEffort` option, this model setting will be ignored.

<Note>
  The 'none' type for `reasoningEffort` is only available for OpenAI's GPT-5.1
  models. Setting `reasoningEffort` to 'none' with other models will result in
  an error.
</Note>

- **reasoningSummary** _'auto' | 'detailed'_
  Controls whether the model returns its reasoning process. Set to `'auto'` for a condensed summary, `'detailed'` for more comprehensive reasoning. Defaults to `undefined` (no reasoning summaries). When enabled, reasoning summaries appear in the stream as events with type `'reasoning'` and in non-streaming responses within the `reasoning` field.

- **strictJsonSchema** _boolean_
  Whether to use strict JSON schema validation. Defaults to `false`.

- **serviceTier** _'auto' | 'flex' | 'priority' | 'default'_
  Service tier for the request. Set to 'flex' for 50% cheaper processing
  at the cost of increased latency (available for o3, o4-mini, and gpt-5 models).
  Set to 'priority' for faster processing with Enterprise access (available for gpt-4, gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, o3, o4-mini; gpt-5-nano is not supported).

  Defaults to 'auto'.

- **textVerbosity** _'low' | 'medium' | 'high'_
  Controls the verbosity of the model's response. Lower values result in more concise responses,
  while higher values result in more verbose responses. Defaults to `'medium'`.

- **include** _Array&lt;string&gt;_
  Specifies additional content to include in the response. Supported values:
  `['file_search_call.results']` for including file search results in responses.
  `['message.output_text.logprobs']` for logprobs.
  Defaults to `undefined`.

- **truncation** _string_
  The truncation strategy to use for the model response.

  - Auto: If the input to this Response exceeds the model's context window size, the model will truncate the response to fit the context window by dropping items from the beginning of the conversation.
  - disabled (default): If the input size will exceed the context window size for a model, the request will fail with a 400 error.

- **promptCacheKey** _string_
  A cache key for manual prompt caching control. Used by OpenAI to cache responses for similar requests to optimize your cache hit rates.

- **promptCacheRetention** _'in_memory' | '24h'_
  The retention policy for the prompt cache. Set to `'24h'` to enable extended prompt caching, which keeps cached prefixes active for up to 24 hours. Defaults to `'in_memory'` for standard prompt caching. Note: `'24h'` is currently only available for the 5.1 series of models.

- **safetyIdentifier** _string_
  A stable identifier used to help detect users of your application that may be violating OpenAI's usage policies. The IDs should be a string that uniquely identifies each user.

The OpenAI responses provider also returns provider-specific metadata:

```ts
const { providerMetadata } = await generateText({
  model: openai.responses('gpt-5'),
});

const openaiMetadata = providerMetadata?.openai;
```

The following OpenAI-specific metadata is returned:

- **responseId** _string_
  The ID of the response. Can be used to continue a conversation.

- **cachedPromptTokens** _number_
  The number of prompt tokens that were a cache hit.

- **reasoningTokens** _number_
  The number of reasoning tokens that the model generated.

#### Reasoning Output

For reasoning models like `gpt-5`, you can enable reasoning summaries to see the model's thought process. Different models support different summarizers—for example, `o4-mini` supports detailed summaries. Set `reasoningSummary: "auto"` to automatically receive the richest level available.

```ts highlight="8-9,16"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = streamText({
  model: openai('gpt-5'),
  prompt: 'Tell me about the Mission burrito debate in San Francisco.',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      reasoningSummary: 'detailed', // 'auto' for condensed or 'detailed' for comprehensive
    },
  },
});

for await (const part of result.fullStream) {
  if (part.type === 'reasoning') {
    console.log(`Reasoning: ${part.textDelta}`);
  } else if (part.type === 'text-delta') {
    process.stdout.write(part.textDelta);
  }
}
```

For non-streaming calls with `generateText`, the reasoning summaries are available in the `reasoning` field of the response:

```ts highlight="8-9,13"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5'),
  prompt: 'Tell me about the Mission burrito debate in San Francisco.',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      reasoningSummary: 'auto',
    },
  },
});
console.log('Reasoning:', result.reasoning);
```

Learn more about reasoning summaries in the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning?api-mode=responses#reasoning-summaries).

#### Verbosity Control

You can control the length and detail of model responses using the `textVerbosity` parameter:

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5-mini'),
  prompt: 'Write a poem about a boy and his first pet dog.',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      textVerbosity: 'low', // 'low' for concise, 'medium' (default), or 'high' for verbose
    },
  },
});
```

The `textVerbosity` parameter scales output length without changing the underlying prompt:

- `'low'`: Produces terse, minimal responses
- `'medium'`: Balanced detail (default)
- `'high'`: Verbose responses with comprehensive detail

#### Web Search Tool

The OpenAI responses API supports web search through the `openai.tools.webSearch` tool.

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5'),
  prompt: 'What happened in San Francisco last week?',
  tools: {
    web_search: openai.tools.webSearch({
      // optional configuration:
      externalWebAccess: true,
      searchContextSize: 'high',
      userLocation: {
        type: 'approximate',
        city: 'San Francisco',
        region: 'California',
      },
    }),
  },
  // Force web search tool (optional):
  toolChoice: { type: 'tool', toolName: 'web_search' },
});

// URL sources directly from `results`
const sources = result.sources;

// Or access sources from tool results
for (const toolResult of result.toolResults) {
  if (toolResult.toolName === 'web_search') {
    console.log('Query:', toolResult.output.action.query);
    console.log('Sources:', toolResult.output.sources);
    // `sources` is an array of object: { type: 'url', url: string }
  }
}
```

For detailed information on configuration options see the [OpenAI Web Search Tool documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search?api-mode=responses).

#### File Search Tool

The OpenAI responses API supports file search through the `openai.tools.fileSearch` tool.

You can force the use of the file search tool by setting the `toolChoice` parameter to `{ type: 'tool', toolName: 'file_search' }`.

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5'),
  prompt: 'What does the document say about user authentication?',
  tools: {
    file_search: openai.tools.fileSearch({
      vectorStoreIds: ['vs_123'],
      // configuration below is optional:
      maxNumResults: 5,
      filters: {
        key: 'author',
        type: 'eq',
        value: 'Jane Smith',
      },
      ranking: {
        ranker: 'auto',
        scoreThreshold: 0.5,
      },
    }),
  },
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      // optional: include results
      include: ['file_search_call.results'],
    } satisfies OpenAIResponsesProviderOptions,
  },
});
```

<Note>
  The tool must be named `file_search` when using OpenAI's file search
  functionality. This name is required by OpenAI's API specification and cannot
  be customized.
</Note>

#### Image Generation Tool

OpenAI's Responses API supports multi-modal image generation as a provider-defined tool.
Availability is restricted to specific models (for example, `gpt-5` variants).

You can use the image tool with either `generateText` or `streamText`:

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5'),
  prompt:
    'Generate an image of an echidna swimming across the Mozambique channel.',
  tools: {
    image_generation: openai.tools.imageGeneration({ outputFormat: 'webp' }),
  },
});

for (const toolResult of result.staticToolResults) {
  if (toolResult.toolName === 'image_generation') {
    const base64Image = toolResult.output.result;
  }
}
```

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = streamText({
  model: openai('gpt-5'),
  prompt:
    'Generate an image of an echidna swimming across the Mozambique channel.',
  tools: {
    image_generation: openai.tools.imageGeneration({
      outputFormat: 'webp',
      quality: 'low',
    }),
  },
});

for await (const part of result.fullStream) {
  if (part.type == 'tool-result' && !part.dynamic) {
    const base64Image = part.output.result;
  }
}
```

<Note>
  When you set `store: false`, then previously generated images will not be
  accessible by the model. We recommend using the image generation tool without
  setting `store: false`.
</Note>

For complete details on model availability, image quality controls, supported sizes, and tool-specific parameters,
refer to the OpenAI documentation:

- Image generation overview and models: [OpenAI Image Generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/image-generation)
- Image generation tool parameters (background, size, quality, format, etc.): [Image Generation Tool Options](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-image-generation#tool-options)

#### Code Interpreter Tool

The OpenAI responses API supports the code interpreter tool through the `openai.tools.codeInterpreter` tool.
This allows models to write and execute Python code.

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5'),
  prompt: 'Write and run Python code to calculate the factorial of 10',
  tools: {
    code_interpreter: openai.tools.codeInterpreter({
      // optional configuration:
      container: {
        fileIds: ['file-123', 'file-456'], // optional file IDs to make available
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

The code interpreter tool can be configured with:

- **container**: Either a container ID string or an object with `fileIds` to specify uploaded files that should be available to the code interpreter

<Note>
  The tool must be named `code_interpreter` when using OpenAI's code interpreter
  functionality. This name is required by OpenAI's API specification and cannot
  be customized.
</Note>

#### MCP Tool

The OpenAI responses API supports connecting to [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers through the `openai.tools.mcp` tool. This allows models to call tools exposed by remote MCP servers or service connectors.

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5'),
  prompt: 'Search the web for the latest news about AI developments',
  tools: {
    mcp: openai.tools.mcp({
      serverLabel: 'web-search',
      serverUrl: 'https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp',
      serverDescription: 'A web-search API for AI agents',
    }),
  },
});
```

The MCP tool can be configured with:

- **serverLabel** _string_ (required)

  A label to identify the MCP server. This label is used in tool calls to distinguish between multiple MCP servers.

- **serverUrl** _string_ (required if `connectorId` is not provided)

  The URL for the MCP server. Either `serverUrl` or `connectorId` must be provided.

- **connectorId** _string_ (required if `serverUrl` is not provided)

  Identifier for a service connector. Either `serverUrl` or `connectorId` must be provided.

- **serverDescription** _string_ (optional)

  Optional description of the MCP server that helps the model understand its purpose.

- **allowedTools** _string[] | object_ (optional)

  Controls which tools from the MCP server are available. Can be:

  - An array of tool names: `['tool1', 'tool2']`
  - An object with filters:
    ```ts
    {
      readOnly: true, // Only allow read-only tools
      toolNames: ['tool1', 'tool2'] // Specific tool names
    }
    ```

- **authorization** _string_ (optional)

  OAuth access token for authenticating with the MCP server or connector.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string, string&gt;_ (optional)

  Optional HTTP headers to include in requests to the MCP server.

<Note>
  The tool calls made by the model when using the OpenAI MCP tool are approved
  by default. Be sure to connect to only trusted MCP servers, who you trust to
  share your data with.
</Note>

<Note>
  The OpenAI MCP tool is different from the general MCP client approach
  documented in [MCP Tools](/docs/ai-sdk-core/mcp-tools). The OpenAI MCP tool is
  a built-in provider-defined tool that allows OpenAI models to directly connect
  to MCP servers, while the general MCP client requires you to convert MCP tools
  to AI SDK tools first.
</Note>

#### Local Shell Tool

The OpenAI responses API support the local shell tool for Codex models through the `openai.tools.localShell` tool.
Local shell is a tool that allows agents to run shell commands locally on a machine you or the user provides.

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai.responses('gpt-5-codex'),
  tools: {
    local_shell: openai.tools.localShell({
      execute: async ({ action }) => {
        // ... your implementation, e.g. sandbox access ...
        return { output: stdout };
      },
    }),
  },
  prompt: 'List the files in my home directory.',
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(2),
});
```

<Note>
  The tool must be named `local_shell`. This name is required by OpenAI's API
  specification and cannot be customized. The model can only be
</Note>

#### Image Inputs

The OpenAI Responses API supports Image inputs for appropriate models.
You can pass Image files as part of the message content using the 'image' type:

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: 'Please describe the image.',
        },
        {
          type: 'image',
          image: fs.readFileSync('./data/image.png'),
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

The model will have access to the image and will respond to questions about it.
The image should be passed using the `image` field.

You can also pass a file-id from the OpenAI Files API.

```ts
{
  type: 'image',
  image: 'file-8EFBcWHsQxZV7YGezBC1fq'
}
```

You can also pass the URL of an image.

```ts
{
  type: 'image',
  image: 'https://sample.edu/image.png',
}
```

#### PDF Inputs

The OpenAI Responses API supports reading PDF files.
You can pass PDF files as part of the message content using the `file` type:

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: 'What is an embedding model?',
        },
        {
          type: 'file',
          data: fs.readFileSync('./data/ai.pdf'),
          mediaType: 'application/pdf',
          filename: 'ai.pdf', // optional
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

You can also pass a file-id from the OpenAI Files API.

```ts
{
  type: 'file',
  data: 'file-8EFBcWHsQxZV7YGezBC1fq',
  mediaType: 'application/pdf',
}
```

You can also pass the URL of a pdf.

```ts
{
  type: 'file',
  data: 'https://sample.edu/example.pdf',
  mediaType: 'application/pdf',
  filename: 'ai.pdf', // optional
}
```

The model will have access to the contents of the PDF file and
respond to questions about it.
The PDF file should be passed using the `data` field,
and the `mediaType` should be set to `'application/pdf'`.

#### Structured Outputs

The OpenAI Responses API supports structured outputs. You can enforce structured outputs using `generateObject` or `streamObject`, which expose a `schema` option. Additionally, you can pass a Zod or JSON Schema object to the `output` option when using `generateText` or `streamText`.

```ts
// Using generateObject
const result = await generateObject({
  model: openai('gpt-4.1'),
  schema: z.object({
    recipe: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      ingredients: z.array(
        z.object({
          name: z.string(),
          amount: z.string(),
        })
      ),
      steps: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});

// Using generateText
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4.1'),
  prompt: 'How do I make a pizza?',
  output: Output.object({
    schema: z.object({
      ingredients: z.array(z.string()),
      steps: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
});
```

### Chat Models

You can create models that call the [OpenAI chat API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) using the `.chat()` factory method.
The first argument is the model id, e.g. `gpt-4`.
The OpenAI chat models support tool calls and some have multi-modal capabilities.

```ts
const model = openai.chat('gpt-5');
```

OpenAI chat models support also some model specific provider options that are not part of the [standard call settings](/docs/ai-sdk-core/settings).
You can pass them in the `providerOptions` argument:

```ts
import { openai, type OpenAIChatLanguageModelOptions } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const model = openai.chat('gpt-5');

await generateText({
  model,
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      logitBias: {
        // optional likelihood for specific tokens
        '50256': -100,
      },
      user: 'test-user', // optional unique user identifier
    } satisfies OpenAIChatLanguageModelOptions,
  },
});
```

The following optional provider options are available for OpenAI chat models:

- **logitBias** _Record&lt;number, number&gt;_

  Modifies the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

  Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in
  the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You
  can use this tokenizer tool to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically,
  the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling.
  The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should
  decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100
  should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

  As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the token from being generated.

- **logprobs** _boolean | number_

  Return the log probabilities of the tokens. Including logprobs will increase
  the response size and can slow down response times. However, it can
  be useful to better understand how the model is behaving.

  Setting to true will return the log probabilities of the tokens that
  were generated.

  Setting to a number will return the log probabilities of the top n
  tokens that were generated.

- **parallelToolCalls** _boolean_

  Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use. Defaults to `true`.

- **user** _string_

  A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to
  monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices/end-user-ids).

- **reasoningEffort** _'minimal' | 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'_

  Reasoning effort for reasoning models. Defaults to `medium`. If you use
  `providerOptions` to set the `reasoningEffort` option, this
  model setting will be ignored.

- **structuredOutputs** _boolean_

  Whether to use structured outputs.
  Defaults to `true`.

  When enabled, tool calls and object generation will be strict and follow the provided schema.

- **maxCompletionTokens** _number_

  Maximum number of completion tokens to generate. Useful for reasoning models.

- **store** _boolean_

  Whether to enable persistence in Responses API.

- **metadata** _Record&lt;string, string&gt;_

  Metadata to associate with the request.

- **prediction** _Record&lt;string, any&gt;_

  Parameters for prediction mode.

- **serviceTier** _'auto' | 'flex' | 'priority' | 'default'_

  Service tier for the request. Set to 'flex' for 50% cheaper processing
  at the cost of increased latency (available for o3, o4-mini, and gpt-5 models).
  Set to 'priority' for faster processing with Enterprise access (available for gpt-4, gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, o3, o4-mini; gpt-5-nano is not supported).

  Defaults to 'auto'.

- **strictJsonSchema** _boolean_

  Whether to use strict JSON schema validation.
  Defaults to `false`.

- **textVerbosity** _'low' | 'medium' | 'high'_

  Controls the verbosity of the model's responses. Lower values will result in more concise responses, while higher values will result in more verbose responses.

- **promptCacheKey** _string_

  A cache key for manual prompt caching control. Used by OpenAI to cache responses for similar requests to optimize your cache hit rates.

- **promptCacheRetention** _'in_memory' | '24h'_

  The retention policy for the prompt cache. Set to `'24h'` to enable extended prompt caching, which keeps cached prefixes active for up to 24 hours. Defaults to `'in_memory'` for standard prompt caching. Note: `'24h'` is currently only available for the 5.1 series of models.

- **safetyIdentifier** _string_

  A stable identifier used to help detect users of your application that may be violating OpenAI's usage policies. The IDs should be a string that uniquely identifies each user.

#### Reasoning

OpenAI has introduced the `o1`,`o3`, and `o4` series of [reasoning models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).
Currently, `o4-mini`, `o3`, `o3-mini`, and `o1` are available via both the chat and responses APIs. The
models `codex-mini-latest` and `computer-use-preview` are available only via the [responses API](#responses-models).

Reasoning models currently only generate text, have several limitations, and are only supported using `generateText` and `streamText`.

They support additional settings and response metadata:

- You can use `providerOptions` to set

  - the `reasoningEffort` option (or alternatively the `reasoningEffort` model setting), which determines the amount of reasoning the model performs.

- You can use response `providerMetadata` to access the number of reasoning tokens that the model generated.

```ts highlight="4,7-11,17"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, usage, providerMetadata } = await generateText({
  model: openai.chat('gpt-5'),
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      reasoningEffort: 'low',
    },
  },
});

console.log(text);
console.log('Usage:', {
  ...usage,
  reasoningTokens: providerMetadata?.openai?.reasoningTokens,
});
```

<Note>
  System messages are automatically converted to OpenAI developer messages for
  reasoning models when supported.
</Note>

<Note>
  Reasoning models require additional runtime inference to complete their
  reasoning phase before generating a response. This introduces longer latency
  compared to other models.
</Note>

<Note>
  `maxOutputTokens` is automatically mapped to `max_completion_tokens` for
  reasoning models.
</Note>

#### Structured Outputs

Structured outputs are enabled by default.
You can disable them by setting the `structuredOutputs` option to `false`.

```ts highlight="7"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const result = await generateObject({
  model: openai.chat('gpt-4o-2024-08-06'),
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      structuredOutputs: false,
    },
  },
  schemaName: 'recipe',
  schemaDescription: 'A recipe for lasagna.',
  schema: z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    ingredients: z.array(
      z.object({
        name: z.string(),
        amount: z.string(),
      })
    ),
    steps: z.array(z.string()),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});

console.log(JSON.stringify(result.object, null, 2));
```

<Note type="warning">
  OpenAI structured outputs have several
  [limitations](https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api),
  in particular around the [supported schemas](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/supported-schemas),
  and are therefore opt-in.

For example, optional schema properties are not supported.
You need to change Zod `.nullish()` and `.optional()` to `.nullable()`.

</Note>

#### Logprobs

OpenAI provides logprobs information for completion/chat models.
You can access it in the `providerMetadata` object.

```ts highlight="11"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai.chat('gpt-5'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      // this can also be a number,
      // refer to logprobs provider options section for more
      logprobs: true,
    },
  },
});

const openaiMetadata = (await result.providerMetadata)?.openai;

const logprobs = openaiMetadata?.logprobs;
```

#### Image Support

The OpenAI Chat API supports Image inputs for appropriate models.
You can pass Image files as part of the message content using the 'image' type:

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai.chat('gpt-5'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: 'Please describe the image.',
        },
        {
          type: 'image',
          image: fs.readFileSync('./data/image.png'),
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

The model will have access to the image and will respond to questions about it.
The image should be passed using the `image` field.

You can also pass the URL of an image.

```ts
{
  type: 'image',
  image: 'https://sample.edu/image.png',
}
```

#### PDF support

The OpenAI Chat API supports reading PDF files.
You can pass PDF files as part of the message content using the `file` type:

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai.chat('gpt-5'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: 'What is an embedding model?',
        },
        {
          type: 'file',
          data: fs.readFileSync('./data/ai.pdf'),
          mediaType: 'application/pdf',
          filename: 'ai.pdf', // optional
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

The model will have access to the contents of the PDF file and
respond to questions about it.
The PDF file should be passed using the `data` field,
and the `mediaType` should be set to `'application/pdf'`.

You can also pass a file-id from the OpenAI Files API.

```ts
{
  type: 'file',
  data: 'file-8EFBcWHsQxZV7YGezBC1fq',
  mediaType: 'application/pdf',
}
```

You can also pass the URL of a PDF.

```ts
{
  type: 'file',
  data: 'https://sample.edu/example.pdf',
  mediaType: 'application/pdf',
  filename: 'ai.pdf', // optional
}
```

#### Predicted Outputs

OpenAI supports [predicted outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/latency-optimization#use-predicted-outputs) for `gpt-4o` and `gpt-4o-mini`.
Predicted outputs help you reduce latency by allowing you to specify a base text that the model should modify.
You can enable predicted outputs by adding the `prediction` option to the `providerOptions.openai` object:

```ts highlight="15-18"
const result = streamText({
  model: openai.chat('gpt-5'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: 'Replace the Username property with an Email property.',
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: existingCode,
    },
  ],
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      prediction: {
        type: 'content',
        content: existingCode,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

OpenAI provides usage information for predicted outputs (`acceptedPredictionTokens` and `rejectedPredictionTokens`).
You can access it in the `providerMetadata` object.

```ts highlight="11"
const openaiMetadata = (await result.providerMetadata)?.openai;

const acceptedPredictionTokens = openaiMetadata?.acceptedPredictionTokens;
const rejectedPredictionTokens = openaiMetadata?.rejectedPredictionTokens;
```

<Note type="warning">
  OpenAI Predicted Outputs have several
  [limitations](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/predicted-outputs#limitations),
  e.g. unsupported API parameters and no tool calling support.
</Note>

#### Image Detail

You can use the `openai` provider option to set the [image input detail](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images-vision?api-mode=responses#specify-image-input-detail-level) to `high`, `low`, or `auto`:

```ts highlight="13-16"
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai.chat('gpt-5'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        { type: 'text', text: 'Describe the image in detail.' },
        {
          type: 'image',
          image:
            'https://github.com/vercel/ai/blob/main/examples/ai-core/data/comic-cat.png?raw=true',

          // OpenAI specific options - image detail:
          providerOptions: {
            openai: { imageDetail: 'low' },
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

<Note type="warning">
  Because the `UIMessage` type (used by AI SDK UI hooks like `useChat`) does not
  support the `providerOptions` property, you can use `convertToModelMessages`
  first before passing the messages to functions like `generateText` or
  `streamText`. For more details on `providerOptions` usage, see
  [here](/docs/foundations/prompts#provider-options).
</Note>

#### Distillation

OpenAI supports model distillation for some models.
If you want to store a generation for use in the distillation process, you can add the `store` option to the `providerOptions.openai` object.
This will save the generation to the OpenAI platform for later use in distillation.

```typescript highlight="9-16"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import 'dotenv/config';

async function main() {
  const { text, usage } = await generateText({
    model: openai.chat('gpt-4o-mini'),
    prompt: 'Who worked on the original macintosh?',
    providerOptions: {
      openai: {
        store: true,
        metadata: {
          custom: 'value',
        },
      },
    },
  });

  console.log(text);
  console.log();
  console.log('Usage:', usage);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

#### Prompt Caching

OpenAI has introduced [Prompt Caching](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-caching) for supported models
including `gpt-4o` and `gpt-4o-mini`.

- Prompt caching is automatically enabled for these models, when the prompt is 1024 tokens or longer. It does
  not need to be explicitly enabled.
- You can use response `providerMetadata` to access the number of prompt tokens that were a cache hit.
- Note that caching behavior is dependent on load on OpenAI's infrastructure. Prompt prefixes generally remain in the
  cache following 5-10 minutes of inactivity before they are evicted, but during off-peak periods they may persist for up
  to an hour.

```ts highlight="11"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, usage, providerMetadata } = await generateText({
  model: openai.chat('gpt-4o-mini'),
  prompt: `A 1024-token or longer prompt...`,
});

console.log(`usage:`, {
  ...usage,
  cachedPromptTokens: providerMetadata?.openai?.cachedPromptTokens,
});
```

To improve cache hit rates, you can manually control caching using the `promptCacheKey` option:

```ts highlight="7-11"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, usage, providerMetadata } = await generateText({
  model: openai.chat('gpt-5'),
  prompt: `A 1024-token or longer prompt...`,
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      promptCacheKey: 'my-custom-cache-key-123',
    },
  },
});

console.log(`usage:`, {
  ...usage,
  cachedPromptTokens: providerMetadata?.openai?.cachedPromptTokens,
});
```

For GPT-5.1 models, you can enable extended prompt caching that keeps cached prefixes active for up to 24 hours:

```ts highlight="7-12"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, usage, providerMetadata } = await generateText({
  model: openai.chat('gpt-5.1'),
  prompt: `A 1024-token or longer prompt...`,
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      promptCacheKey: 'my-custom-cache-key-123',
      promptCacheRetention: '24h', // Extended caching for GPT-5.1
    },
  },
});

console.log(`usage:`, {
  ...usage,
  cachedPromptTokens: providerMetadata?.openai?.cachedPromptTokens,
});
```

#### Audio Input

With the `gpt-4o-audio-preview` model, you can pass audio files to the model.

<Note type="warning">
  The `gpt-4o-audio-preview` model is currently in preview and requires at least
  some audio inputs. It will not work with non-audio data.
</Note>

```ts highlight="12-14"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai.chat('gpt-4o-audio-preview'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        { type: 'text', text: 'What is the audio saying?' },
        {
          type: 'file',
          mediaType: 'audio/mpeg',
          data: fs.readFileSync('./data/galileo.mp3'),
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

### Completion Models

You can create models that call the [OpenAI completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) using the `.completion()` factory method.
The first argument is the model id.
Currently only `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct` is supported.

```ts
const model = openai.completion('gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct');
```

OpenAI completion models support also some model specific settings that are not part of the [standard call settings](/docs/ai-sdk-core/settings).
You can pass them as an options argument:

```ts
const model = openai.completion('gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct');

await model.doGenerate({
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      echo: true, // optional, echo the prompt in addition to the completion
      logitBias: {
        // optional likelihood for specific tokens
        '50256': -100,
      },
      suffix: 'some text', // optional suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text
      user: 'test-user', // optional unique user identifier
    },
  },
});
```

The following optional provider options are available for OpenAI completion models:

- **echo**: _boolean_

  Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion.

- **logitBias** _Record&lt;number, number&gt;_

  Modifies the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

  Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in
  the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You
  can use this tokenizer tool to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically,
  the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling.
  The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should
  decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100
  should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

  As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the &lt;|endoftext|&gt;
  token from being generated.

- **logprobs** _boolean | number_

  Return the log probabilities of the tokens. Including logprobs will increase
  the response size and can slow down response times. However, it can
  be useful to better understand how the model is behaving.

  Setting to true will return the log probabilities of the tokens that
  were generated.

  Setting to a number will return the log probabilities of the top n
  tokens that were generated.

- **suffix** _string_

  The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.

- **user** _string_

  A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to
  monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices/end-user-ids).

  docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) for a full list of available
  models. The table above lists popular models. You can also pass any available
  provider model ID as a string if needed.
</Note>

## Embedding Models

You can create models that call the [OpenAI embeddings API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings)
using the `.textEmbedding()` factory method.

```ts
const model = openai.textEmbedding('text-embedding-3-large');
```

OpenAI embedding models support several additional provider options.
You can pass them as an options argument:

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { embed } from 'ai';

const { embedding } = await embed({
  model: openai.textEmbedding('text-embedding-3-large'),
  value: 'sunny day at the beach',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      dimensions: 512, // optional, number of dimensions for the embedding
      user: 'test-user', // optional unique user identifier
    },
  },
});
```

The following optional provider options are available for OpenAI embedding models:

- **dimensions**: _number_

  The number of dimensions the resulting output embeddings should have.
  Only supported in text-embedding-3 and later models.

- **user** _string_

  A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to
  monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices/end-user-ids).

### Model Capabilities

| Model                    | Default Dimensions | Custom Dimensions   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| `text-embedding-3-large` | 3072               | <Check size={18} /> |
| `text-embedding-3-small` | 1536               | <Check size={18} /> |
| `text-embedding-ada-002` | 1536               | <Cross size={18} /> |

## Image Models

You can create models that call the [OpenAI image generation API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images)
using the `.image()` factory method.

```ts
const model = openai.image('dall-e-3');
```

<Note>
  Dall-E models do not support the `aspectRatio` parameter. Use the `size`
  parameter instead.
</Note>

### Model Capabilities

| Model              | Sizes                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `gpt-image-1-mini` | 1024x1024, 1536x1024, 1024x1536 |
| `gpt-image-1`      | 1024x1024, 1536x1024, 1024x1536 |
| `dall-e-3`         | 1024x1024, 1792x1024, 1024x1792 |
| `dall-e-2`         | 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024     |

You can pass optional `providerOptions` to the image model. These are prone to change by OpenAI and are model dependent. For example, the `gpt-image-1` model supports the `quality` option:

```ts
const { image, providerMetadata } = await generateImage({
  model: openai.image('gpt-image-1'),
  prompt: 'A salamander at sunrise in a forest pond in the Seychelles.',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: { quality: 'high' },
  },
});
```

For more on `generateImage()` see [Image Generation](/docs/ai-sdk-core/image-generation).

OpenAI's image models may return a revised prompt for each image. It can be access at `providerMetadata.openai.images[0]?.revisedPrompt`.

For more information on the available OpenAI image model options, see the [OpenAI API reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create).

## Transcription Models

You can create models that call the [OpenAI transcription API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/transcribe)
using the `.transcription()` factory method.

The first argument is the model id e.g. `whisper-1`.

```ts
const model = openai.transcription('whisper-1');
```

You can also pass additional provider-specific options using the `providerOptions` argument. For example, supplying the input language in ISO-639-1 (e.g. `en`) format will improve accuracy and latency.

```ts highlight="6"
import { experimental_transcribe as transcribe } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const result = await transcribe({
  model: openai.transcription('whisper-1'),
  audio: new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3, 4]),
  providerOptions: { openai: { language: 'en' } },
});
```

To get word-level timestamps, specify the granularity:

```ts highlight="8-9"
import { experimental_transcribe as transcribe } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const result = await transcribe({
  model: openai.transcription('whisper-1'),
  audio: new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3, 4]),
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      //timestampGranularities: ['word'],
      timestampGranularities: ['segment'],
    },
  },
});

// Access word-level timestamps
console.log(result.segments); // Array of segments with startSecond/endSecond
```

The following provider options are available:

- **timestampGranularities** _string[]_
  The granularity of the timestamps in the transcription.
  Defaults to `['segment']`.
  Possible values are `['word']`, `['segment']`, and `['word', 'segment']`.
  Note: There is no additional latency for segment timestamps, but generating word timestamps incurs additional latency.

- **language** _string_
  The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in ISO-639-1 format (e.g. 'en') will improve accuracy and latency.
  Optional.

- **prompt** _string_
  An optional text to guide the model's style or continue a previous audio segment. The prompt should match the audio language.
  Optional.

- **temperature** _number_
  The sampling temperature, between 0 and 1. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. If set to 0, the model will use log probability to automatically increase the temperature until certain thresholds are hit.
  Defaults to 0.
  Optional.

- **include** _string[]_
  Additional information to include in the transcription response.

### Model Capabilities

| Model                    | Transcription       | Duration            | Segments            | Language            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| `whisper-1`              | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> |
| `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` | <Check size={18} /> | <Cross size={18} /> | <Cross size={18} /> | <Cross size={18} /> |
| `gpt-4o-transcribe`      | <Check size={18} /> | <Cross size={18} /> | <Cross size={18} /> | <Cross size={18} /> |

## Speech Models

You can create models that call the [OpenAI speech API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/speech)
using the `.speech()` factory method.

The first argument is the model id e.g. `tts-1`.

```ts
const model = openai.speech('tts-1');
```

You can also pass additional provider-specific options using the `providerOptions` argument. For example, supplying a voice to use for the generated audio.

```ts highlight="6"
import { experimental_generateSpeech as generateSpeech } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const result = await generateSpeech({
  model: openai.speech('tts-1'),
  text: 'Hello, world!',
  providerOptions: { openai: {} },
});
```

- **instructions** _string_
  Control the voice of your generated audio with additional instructions e.g. "Speak in a slow and steady tone".
  Does not work with `tts-1` or `tts-1-hd`.
  Optional.

- **response_format** _string_
  The format to audio in.
  Supported formats are `mp3`, `opus`, `aac`, `flac`, `wav`, and `pcm`.
  Defaults to `mp3`.
  Optional.

- **speed** _number_
  The speed of the generated audio.
  Select a value from 0.25 to 4.0.
  Defaults to 1.0.
  Optional.

### Model Capabilities

| Model             | Instructions        |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| `tts-1`           | <Check size={18} /> |
| `tts-1-hd`        | <Check size={18} /> |
| `gpt-4o-mini-tts` | <Check size={18} /> |

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `azure` from `@ai-sdk/azure`:

```ts
import { azure } from '@ai-sdk/azure';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createAzure` from `@ai-sdk/azure` and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createAzure } from '@ai-sdk/azure';

const azure = createAzure({
  resourceName: 'your-resource-name', // Azure resource name
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the OpenAI provider instance:

- **resourceName** _string_

  Azure resource name.
  It defaults to the `AZURE_RESOURCE_NAME` environment variable.

  The resource name is used in the assembled URL: `https://{resourceName}.openai.azure.com/openai/v1{path}`.
  You can use `baseURL` instead to specify the URL prefix.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `api-key` header.
  It defaults to the `AZURE_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **apiVersion** _string_

  Sets a custom [api version](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/api-version-deprecation).
  Defaults to `v1`.

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls, e.g. to use proxy servers.

  Either this or `resourceName` can be used.
  When a baseURL is provided, the resourceName is ignored.

  With a baseURL, the resolved URL is `{baseURL}/v1{path}`.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  Defaults to the global `fetch` function.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

- **useDeploymentBasedUrls** _boolean_

  Use deployment-based URLs for API calls. Set to `true` to use the legacy deployment format:
  `{baseURL}/deployments/{deploymentId}{path}?api-version={apiVersion}` instead of
  `{baseURL}/v1{path}?api-version={apiVersion}`.
  Defaults to `false`.

  This option is useful for compatibility with certain Azure OpenAI models or deployments
  that require the legacy endpoint format.

## Language Models

The Azure OpenAI provider instance is a function that you can invoke to create a language model:

```ts
const model = azure('your-deployment-name');
```

You need to pass your deployment name as the first argument.

### Reasoning Models

Azure exposes the thinking of `DeepSeek-R1` in the generated text using the `<think>` tag.
You can use the `extractReasoningMiddleware` to extract this reasoning and expose it as a `reasoning` property on the result:

```ts
import { azure } from '@ai-sdk/azure';
import { wrapLanguageModel, extractReasoningMiddleware } from 'ai';

const enhancedModel = wrapLanguageModel({
  model: azure('your-deepseek-r1-deployment-name'),
  middleware: extractReasoningMiddleware({ tagName: 'think' }),
});
```

You can then use that enhanced model in functions like `generateText` and `streamText`.

<Note>
  The Azure provider calls the Responses API by default (unless you specify e.g.
  `azure.chat`).
</Note>

### Example

You can use OpenAI language models to generate text with the `generateText` function:

```ts
import { azure } from '@ai-sdk/azure';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: azure('your-deployment-name'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

OpenAI language models can also be used in the `streamText`, `generateObject`, and `streamObject` functions
(see [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core)).

<Note>
  Azure OpenAI sends larger chunks than OpenAI. This can lead to the perception
  that the response is slower. See [Troubleshooting: Azure OpenAI Slow To
  Stream](/docs/troubleshooting/common-issues/azure-stream-slow)
</Note>

### Provider Options

When using OpenAI language models on Azure, you can configure provider-specific options using `providerOptions.openai`. More information on available configuration options are on [the OpenAI provider page](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/openai#language-models).

```ts highlight="12-14,22-24"
const messages = [
  {
    role: 'user',
    content: [
      {
        type: 'text',
        text: 'What is the capital of the moon?',
      },
      {
        type: 'image',
        image: 'https://example.com/image.png',
        providerOptions: {
          openai: { imageDetail: 'low' },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
];

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: azure('your-deployment-name'),
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      reasoningEffort: 'low',
    },
  },
});
```

### Chat Models

<Note>
  The URL for calling Azure chat models will be constructed as follows:
  `https://RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/v1/chat/completions?api-version=v1`
</Note>

You can create models that call the Azure OpenAI chat completions API using the `.chat()` factory method:

```ts
const model = azure.chat('your-deployment-name');
```

Azure OpenAI chat models support also some model specific settings that are not part of the [standard call settings](/docs/ai-sdk-core/settings).
You can pass them as an options argument:

```ts
import { azure } from '@ai-sdk/azure';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: azure.chat('your-deployment-name'),
  prompt: 'Write a short story about a robot.',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      logitBias: {
        // optional likelihood for specific tokens
        '50256': -100,
      },
      user: 'test-user', // optional unique user identifier
    },
  },
});
```

The following optional provider options are available for OpenAI chat models:

- **logitBias** _Record&lt;number, number&gt;_

  Modifies the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

  Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in
  the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You
  can use this tokenizer tool to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically,
  the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling.
  The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should
  decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100
  should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

  As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the token from being generated.

- **logprobs** _boolean | number_

  Return the log probabilities of the tokens. Including logprobs will increase
  the response size and can slow down response times. However, it can
  be useful to better understand how the model is behaving.

  Setting to true will return the log probabilities of the tokens that
  were generated.

  Setting to a number will return the log probabilities of the top n
  tokens that were generated.

- **parallelToolCalls** _boolean_

  Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use. Default to true.

- **user** _string_

  A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to
  monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.

### Responses Models

Azure OpenAI uses responses API as default with the `azure(deploymentName)` factory method.

```ts
const model = azure('your-deployment-name');
```

Further configuration can be done using OpenAI provider options.
You can validate the provider options using the `OpenAIResponsesProviderOptions` type.

```ts
import { azure, OpenAIResponsesProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/azure';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: azure('your-deployment-name'),
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      parallelToolCalls: false,
      store: false,
      user: 'user_123',
      // ...
    } satisfies OpenAIResponsesProviderOptions,
  },
  // ...
});
```

The following provider options are available:

- **parallelToolCalls** _boolean_
  Whether to use parallel tool calls. Defaults to `true`.

- **store** _boolean_
  Whether to store the generation. Defaults to `true`.

- **metadata** _Record&lt;string, string&gt;_
  Additional metadata to store with the generation.

- **previousResponseId** _string_
  The ID of the previous response. You can use it to continue a conversation. Defaults to `undefined`.

- **instructions** _string_
  Instructions for the model.
  They can be used to change the system or developer message when continuing a conversation using the `previousResponseId` option.
  Defaults to `undefined`.

- **user** _string_
  A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. Defaults to `undefined`.

- **reasoningEffort** _'low' | 'medium' | 'high'_
  Reasoning effort for reasoning models. Defaults to `medium`. If you use `providerOptions` to set the `reasoningEffort` option, this model setting will be ignored.

- **strictJsonSchema** _boolean_
  Whether to use strict JSON schema validation. Defaults to `false`.

The Azure OpenAI provider also returns provider-specific metadata:

```ts
const { providerMetadata } = await generateText({
  model: azure('your-deployment-name'),
});

const openaiMetadata = providerMetadata?.openai;
```

The following OpenAI-specific metadata is returned:

- **responseId** _string_
  The ID of the response. Can be used to continue a conversation.

- **cachedPromptTokens** _number_
  The number of prompt tokens that were a cache hit.

- **reasoningTokens** _number_
  The number of reasoning tokens that the model generated.

<Note>
  The providerMetadata is only returned with the default responses API, and is
  not supported when using 'azure.chat' or 'azure.completion'
</Note>

#### Web Search Tool

The Azure OpenAI responses API supports web search(preview) through the `azure.tools.webSearchPreview` tool.

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: azure('gpt-4.1-mini'),
  prompt: 'What happened in San Francisco last week?',
  tools: {
    web_search_preview: azure.tools.webSearchPreview({
      // optional configuration:
      searchContextSize: 'low',
      userLocation: {
        type: 'approximate',
        city: 'San Francisco',
        region: 'California',
      },
    }),
  },
  // Force web search tool (optional):
  toolChoice: { type: 'tool', toolName: 'web_search_preview' },
});

console.log(result.text);

// URL sources directly from `results`
const sources = result.sources;
for (const source of sources) {
  console.log('source:', source);
}
```

<Note>
  The tool must be named `web_search_preview` when using Azure OpenAI's web
  search(preview) functionality. This name is required by Azure OpenAI's API
  specification and cannot be customized.
</Note>

<Note>
  The 'web_search_preview' tool is only supported with the default responses
  API, and is not supported when using 'azure.chat' or 'azure.completion'
</Note>

#### File Search Tool

The Azure OpenAI provider supports file search through the `azure.tools.fileSearch` tool.

You can force the use of the file search tool by setting the `toolChoice` parameter to `{ type: 'tool', toolName: 'file_search' }`.

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: azure('gpt-5'),
  prompt: 'What does the document say about user authentication?',
  tools: {
    file_search: azure.tools.fileSearch({
      // optional configuration:
      vectorStoreIds: ['vs_123', 'vs_456'],
      maxNumResults: 10,
      ranking: {
        ranker: 'auto',
      },
    }),
  },
  // Force file search tool:
  toolChoice: { type: 'tool', toolName: 'file_search' },
});
```

<Note>
  The tool must be named `file_search` when using Azure OpenAI's file search
  functionality. This name is required by Azure OpenAI's API specification and
  cannot be customized.
</Note>

<Note>
  The 'file_search' tool is only supported with the default responses API, and
  is not supported when using 'azure.chat' or 'azure.completion'
</Note>

#### Image Generation Tool

<Note type="warning">
  Azure OpenAI Responses API
  [image_generation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/responses?tabs=python-secure#image-generation-preview)
  is now Preview release(Not GA release).Image tool does not currently support
  streaming mode. You can not use the image tool with `streamText` currently.
</Note>

Azure OpenAI's Responses API supports multi-modal image generation as a provider-defined tool.
Availability is restricted to specific models (for example, `gpt-5` variants).

You can use the image tool with `generateText`.

```ts
import { createAzure } from '@ai-sdk/azure';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const azure = createAzure({
  headers: {
    'x-ms-oai-image-generation-deployment': 'gpt-image-1', // use your own image model deployment
  },
});

const result = await generateText({
  model: azure('gpt-5'),
  prompt:
    'Generate an image of an echidna swimming across the Mozambique channel.',
  tools: {
    image_generation: azure.tools.imageGeneration({ outputFormat: 'png' }),
  },
});

for (const toolResult of result.staticToolResults) {
  if (toolResult.toolName === 'image_generation') {
    const base64Image = toolResult.output.result;
  }
}
```

<Note>
  To use image_generation, you must first create an image generation model. You
  must add a deployment specification to the header
  `x-ms-oai-image-generation-deployment`. Please note that the Responses API
  model and the image generation model must be in the same resource.
</Note>

<Note>
  When you set `store: false`, then previously generated images will not be
  accessible by the model. We recommend using the image generation tool without
  setting `store: false`.
</Note>

#### Code Interpreter Tool

The Azure OpenAI provider supports the code interpreter tool through the `azure.tools.codeInterpreter` tool. This allows models to write and execute Python code.

```ts
import { azure } from '@ai-sdk/azure';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: azure('gpt-5'),
  prompt: 'Write and run Python code to calculate the factorial of 10',
  tools: {
    code_interpreter: azure.tools.codeInterpreter({
      // optional configuration:
      container: {
        fileIds: ['assistant-123', 'assistant-456'], // optional file IDs to make available
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

The code interpreter tool can be configured with:

- **container**: Either a container ID string or an object with `fileIds` to specify uploaded files that should be available to the code interpreter

<Note>
  The tool must be named `code_interpreter` when using Azure OpenAI's code
  interpreter functionality. This name is required by Azure OpenAI's API
  specification and cannot be customized.
</Note>

<Note>
  The 'code_interpreter' tool is only supported with the default responses API,
  and is not supported when using 'azure.chat' or 'azure.completion'
</Note>

#### PDF support

The Azure OpenAI provider supports reading PDF files.
You can pass PDF files as part of the message content using the `file` type:

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: azure('your-deployment-name'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: 'What is an embedding model?',
        },
        {
          type: 'file',
          data: fs.readFileSync('./data/ai.pdf'),
          mediaType: 'application/pdf',
          filename: 'ai.pdf', // optional
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

The model will have access to the contents of the PDF file and
respond to questions about it.
The PDF file should be passed using the `data` field,
and the `mediaType` should be set to `'application/pdf'`.

<Note>
  Reading PDF files are only supported with the default responses API, and is
  not supported when using 'azure.chat' or 'azure.completion'
</Note>

### Completion Models

You can create models that call the completions API using the `.completion()` factory method.
The first argument is the model id.
Currently only `gpt-35-turbo-instruct` is supported.

```ts
const model = azure.completion('your-gpt-35-turbo-instruct-deployment');
```

OpenAI completion models support also some model specific settings that are not part of the [standard call settings](/docs/ai-sdk-core/settings).
You can pass them as an options argument:

```ts
import { azure } from '@ai-sdk/azure';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: azure.completion('your-gpt-35-turbo-instruct-deployment'),
  prompt: 'Write a haiku about coding.',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      echo: true, // optional, echo the prompt in addition to the completion
      logitBias: {
        // optional likelihood for specific tokens
        '50256': -100,
      },
      suffix: 'some text', // optional suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text
      user: 'test-user', // optional unique user identifier
    },
  },
});
```

The following optional provider options are available for Azure OpenAI completion models:

- **echo**: _boolean_

  Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion.

- **logitBias** _Record&lt;number, number&gt;_

  Modifies the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

  Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in
  the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You
  can use this tokenizer tool to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically,
  the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling.
  The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should
  decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100
  should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

  As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the &lt;|endoftext|&gt;
  token from being generated.

- **logprobs** _boolean | number_

  Return the log probabilities of the tokens. Including logprobs will increase
  the response size and can slow down response times. However, it can
  be useful to better understand how the model is behaving.

  Setting to true will return the log probabilities of the tokens that
  were generated.

  Setting to a number will return the log probabilities of the top n
  tokens that were generated.

- **suffix** _string_

  The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.

- **user** _string_

  A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to
  monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.

## Embedding Models

You can create models that call the Azure OpenAI embeddings API
using the `.textEmbedding()` factory method.

```ts
const model = azure.textEmbedding('your-embedding-deployment');
```

Azure OpenAI embedding models support several additional settings.
You can pass them as an options argument:

```ts
import { azure } from '@ai-sdk/azure';
import { embed } from 'ai';

const { embedding } = await embed({
  model: azure.textEmbedding('your-embedding-deployment'),
  value: 'sunny day at the beach',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      dimensions: 512, // optional, number of dimensions for the embedding
      user: 'test-user', // optional unique user identifier
    },
  },
});
```

The following optional provider options are available for Azure OpenAI embedding models:

- **dimensions**: _number_

  The number of dimensions the resulting output embeddings should have.
  Only supported in text-embedding-3 and later models.

- **user** _string_

  A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to
  monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.

## Image Models

You can create models that call the Azure OpenAI image generation API (DALL-E) using the `.image()` factory method. The first argument is your deployment name for the DALL-E model.

```ts
const model = azure.image('your-dalle-deployment-name');
```

Azure OpenAI image models support several additional settings. You can pass them as `providerOptions.openai` when generating the image:

```ts
await generateImage({
  model: azure.image('your-dalle-deployment-name'),
  prompt: 'A photorealistic image of a cat astronaut floating in space',
  size: '1024x1024', // '1024x1024', '1792x1024', or '1024x1792' for DALL-E 3
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      user: 'test-user', // optional unique user identifier
      responseFormat: 'url', // 'url' or 'b64_json', defaults to 'url'
    },
  },
});
```

### Example

You can use Azure OpenAI image models to generate images with the `generateImage` function:

```ts
import { azure } from '@ai-sdk/azure';
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';

const { image } = await generateImage({
  model: azure.image('your-dalle-deployment-name'),
  prompt: 'A photorealistic image of a cat astronaut floating in space',
  size: '1024x1024', // '1024x1024', '1792x1024', or '1024x1792' for DALL-E 3
});

// image contains the URL or base64 data of the generated image
console.log(image);
```

### Model Capabilities

Azure OpenAI supports DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3 models through deployments. The capabilities depend on which model version your deployment is using:

| Model Version | Sizes                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| DALL-E 3      | 1024x1024, 1792x1024, 1024x1792 |
| DALL-E 2      | 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024     |

<Note>
  DALL-E models do not support the `aspectRatio` parameter. Use the `size`
  parameter instead.
</Note>

<Note>
  When creating your Azure OpenAI deployment, make sure to set the DALL-E model
  version you want to use.
</Note>

## Transcription Models

You can create models that call the Azure OpenAI transcription API using the `.transcription()` factory method.

The first argument is the model id e.g. `whisper-1`.

```ts
const model = azure.transcription('whisper-1');
```

<Note>
  If you encounter a "DeploymentNotFound" error with transcription models,
  try enabling deployment-based URLs:
  
  ```ts
  const azure = createAzure({
    useDeploymentBasedUrls: true,
    apiVersion: '2025-04-01-preview',
  });
  ```
  
  This uses the legacy endpoint format which may be required for certain Azure OpenAI deployments.
  When using useDeploymentBasedUrls, the default api-version is not valid. You must set it to `2025-04-01-preview` or an earlier value.
</Note>

You can also pass additional provider-specific options using the `providerOptions` argument. For example, supplying the input language in ISO-639-1 (e.g. `en`) format will improve accuracy and latency.

```ts highlight="6"
import { experimental_transcribe as transcribe } from 'ai';
import { azure } from '@ai-sdk/azure';
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';

const result = await transcribe({
  model: azure.transcription('whisper-1'),
  audio: await readFile('audio.mp3'),
  providerOptions: { openai: { language: 'en' } },
});
```

The following provider options are available:

- **timestampGranularities** _string[]_
  The granularity of the timestamps in the transcription.
  Defaults to `['segment']`.
  Possible values are `['word']`, `['segment']`, and `['word', 'segment']`.
  Note: There is no additional latency for segment timestamps, but generating word timestamps incurs additional latency.

- **language** _string_
  The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in ISO-639-1 format (e.g. 'en') will improve accuracy and latency.
  Optional.

- **prompt** _string_
  An optional text to guide the model's style or continue a previous audio segment. The prompt should match the audio language.
  Optional.

- **temperature** _number_
  The sampling temperature, between 0 and 1. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. If set to 0, the model will use log probability to automatically increase the temperature until certain thresholds are hit.
  Defaults to 0.
  Optional.

- **include** _string[]_
  Additional information to include in the transcription response.

### Model Capabilities

| Model                    | Transcription       | Duration            | Segments            | Language            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| `whisper-1`              | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> |
| `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` | <Check size={18} /> | <Cross size={18} /> | <Cross size={18} /> | <Cross size={18} /> |
| `gpt-4o-transcribe`      | <Check size={18} /> | <Cross size={18} /> | <Cross size={18} /> | <Cross size={18} /> |

# Anthropic Provider

The [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) provider contains language model support for the [Anthropic Messages API](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/messages_post).

## Setup

The Anthropic provider is available in the `@ai-sdk/anthropic` module. You can install it with

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/anthropic" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/anthropic" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/anthropic" dark />
</Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="bun add @ai-sdk/anthropic" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `anthropic` from `@ai-sdk/anthropic`:

```ts
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createAnthropic` from `@ai-sdk/anthropic` and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createAnthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';

const anthropic = createAnthropic({
  // custom settings
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the Anthropic provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls, e.g. to use proxy servers.
  The default prefix is `https://api.anthropic.com/v1`.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `x-api-key` header.
  It defaults to the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  Defaults to the global `fetch` function.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

## Language Models

You can create models that call the [Anthropic Messages API](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/messages_post) using the provider instance.
The first argument is the model id, e.g. `claude-3-haiku-20240307`.
Some models have multi-modal capabilities.

```ts
const model = anthropic('claude-3-haiku-20240307');
```

You can use Anthropic language models to generate text with the `generateText` function:

```ts
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-3-haiku-20240307'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

Anthropic language models can also be used in the `streamText`, `generateObject`, and `streamObject` functions
(see [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core)).

The following optional provider options are available for Anthropic models:

- `disableParallelToolUse` _boolean_

  Optional. Disables the use of parallel tool calls. Defaults to `false`.

  When set to `true`, the model will only call one tool at a time instead of potentially calling multiple tools in parallel.

- `sendReasoning` _boolean_

  Optional. Include reasoning content in requests sent to the model. Defaults to `true`.

  If you are experiencing issues with the model handling requests involving
  reasoning content, you can set this to `false` to omit them from the request.

- `effort` _"high" | "medium" | "low"_

  Optional. See [Effort section](#effort) for more details.

- `thinking` _object_

  Optional. See [Reasoning section](#reasoning) for more details.

- `toolStreaming` _boolean_

  Whether to enable tool streaming (and structured output streaming). Default to `true`.

- `structuredOutputMode` _"outputFormat" | "jsonTool" | "auto"_

  Determines how structured outputs are generated. Optional.

  - `"outputFormat"`: Use the `output_format` parameter to specify the structured output format.
  - `"jsonTool"`: Use a special `"json"` tool to specify the structured output format.
  - `"auto"`: Use `"outputFormat"` when supported, otherwise fall back to `"jsonTool"` (default).

### Structured Outputs and Tool Input Streaming

Tool call streaming is enabled by default. You can opt out by setting the
`toolStreaming` provider option to `false`.

```ts
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { streamText, tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const result = streamText({
  model: anthropic('claude-sonnet-4-20250514'),
  tools: {
    writeFile: tool({
      description: 'Write content to a file',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        path: z.string(),
        content: z.string(),
      }),
      execute: async ({ path, content }) => {
        // Implementation
        return { success: true };
      },
    }),
  },
  prompt: 'Write a short story to story.txt',
});
```

### Effort

Anthropic introduced an `effort` option with `claude-opus-4-5` that affects thinking, text responses, and function calls. Effort defaults to `high` and you can set it to `medium` or `low` to save tokens and to lower time-to-last-token latency (TTLT).

```ts highlight="8-10"
import { anthropic, AnthropicProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, usage } = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-opus-4-20250514'),
  prompt: 'How many people will live in the world in 2040?',
  providerOptions: {
    anthropic: {
      effort: 'low',
    } satisfies AnthropicProviderOptions,
  },
});

console.log(text); // resulting text
console.log(usage); // token usage
```

### Reasoning

Anthropic has reasoning support for `claude-opus-4-20250514`, `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, and `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219` models.

You can enable it using the `thinking` provider option
and specifying a thinking budget in tokens.

```ts highlight="4,8-10"
import { anthropic, AnthropicProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, reasoning, reasoningDetails } = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-opus-4-20250514'),
  prompt: 'How many people will live in the world in 2040?',
  providerOptions: {
    anthropic: {
      thinking: { type: 'enabled', budgetTokens: 12000 },
    } satisfies AnthropicProviderOptions,
  },
});

console.log(reasoning); // reasoning text
console.log(reasoningDetails); // reasoning details including redacted reasoning
console.log(text); // text response
```

See [AI SDK UI: Chatbot](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot#reasoning) for more details
on how to integrate reasoning into your chatbot.

### Cache Control

In the messages and message parts, you can use the `providerOptions` property to set cache control breakpoints.
You need to set the `anthropic` property in the `providerOptions` object to `{ cacheControl: { type: 'ephemeral' } }` to set a cache control breakpoint.

The cache creation input tokens are then returned in the `providerMetadata` object
for `generateText` and `generateObject`, again under the `anthropic` property.
When you use `streamText` or `streamObject`, the response contains a promise
that resolves to the metadata. Alternatively you can receive it in the
`onFinish` callback.

```ts highlight="8,18-20,29-30"
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const errorMessage = '... long error message ...';

const result = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        { type: 'text', text: 'You are a JavaScript expert.' },
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: `Error message: ${errorMessage}`,
          providerOptions: {
            anthropic: { cacheControl: { type: 'ephemeral' } },
          },
        },
        { type: 'text', text: 'Explain the error message.' },
      ],
    },
  ],
});

console.log(result.text);
console.log(result.providerMetadata?.anthropic);
// e.g. { cacheCreationInputTokens: 2118 }
```

You can also use cache control on system messages by providing multiple system messages at the head of your messages array:

```ts highlight="3,7-9"
const result = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'system',
      content: 'Cached system message part',
      providerOptions: {
        anthropic: { cacheControl: { type: 'ephemeral' } },
      },
    },
    {
      role: 'system',
      content: 'Uncached system message part',
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: 'User prompt',
    },
  ],
});
```

Cache control for tools:

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-3-5-haiku-latest'),
  tools: {
    cityAttractions: tool({
      inputSchema: z.object({ city: z.string() }),
      providerOptions: {
        anthropic: {
          cacheControl: { type: 'ephemeral' },
        },
      },
    }),
  },
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: 'User prompt',
    },
  ],
});
```

#### Longer cache TTL

Anthropic also supports a longer 1-hour cache duration.

Here's an example:

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-3-5-haiku-latest'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: 'Long cached message',
          providerOptions: {
            anthropic: {
              cacheControl: { type: 'ephemeral', ttl: '1h' },
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

#### Limitations

The minimum cacheable prompt length is:

- 1024 tokens for Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Opus
- 2048 tokens for Claude 3.5 Haiku and Claude 3 Haiku

Shorter prompts cannot be cached, even if marked with `cacheControl`. Any requests to cache fewer than this number of tokens will be processed without caching.

For more on prompt caching with Anthropic, see [Anthropic's Cache Control documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching).

<Note type="warning">
  Because the `UIMessage` type (used by AI SDK UI hooks like `useChat`) does not
  support the `providerOptions` property, you can use `convertToModelMessages`
  first before passing the messages to functions like `generateText` or
  `streamText`. For more details on `providerOptions` usage, see
  [here](/docs/foundations/prompts#provider-options).
</Note>

### Bash Tool

The Bash Tool allows running bash commands. Here's how to create and use it:

```ts
const bashTool = anthropic.tools.bash_20241022({
  execute: async ({ command, restart }) => {
    // Implement your bash command execution logic here
    // Return the result of the command execution
  },
});
```

Parameters:

- `command` (string): The bash command to run. Required unless the tool is being restarted.
- `restart` (boolean, optional): Specifying true will restart this tool.

<Note>
  The bash tool must have the name `bash`. Only certain Claude versions are
  supported.
</Note>

### Memory Tool

The [Memory Tool](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/memory-tool) allows Claude to use a local memory, e.g. in the filesystem.
Here's how to create it:

```ts
const memory = anthropic.tools.memory_20250818({
  execute: async (action) => {
    // Implement your memory command execution logic here
    // Return the result of the command execution
  },
});
```

<Note>
  The memory tool must have the name `memory`. Only certain Claude versions are
  supported.
</Note>

### Text Editor Tool

The Text Editor Tool provides functionality for viewing and editing text files.

```ts
const tools = {
  // tool name must be str_replace_based_edit_tool
  str_replace_based_edit_tool: anthropic.tools.textEditor_20250728({
    maxCharacters: 10000, // optional
    async execute({ command, path, old_str, new_str }) {
      // ...
    },
  }),
} satisfies ToolSet;
```

<Note>
  Different models support different versions of the tool. For Claude Sonnet 3.5
  and 3.7 you need to use older tool versions and tool names.
</Note>

Parameters:

- `command` ('view' | 'create' | 'str_replace' | 'insert' | 'undo_edit'): The command to run. Note: `undo_edit` is only available in Claude 3.5 Sonnet and earlier models.
- `path` (string): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.
- `file_text` (string, optional): Required for `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
- `insert_line` (number, optional): Required for `insert` command. The line number after which to insert the new string.
- `new_str` (string, optional): New string for `str_replace` or `insert` commands.
- `old_str` (string, optional): Required for `str_replace` command, containing the string to replace.
- `view_range` (number[], optional): Optional for `view` command to specify line range to show.

### Computer Tool

The Computer Tool enables control of keyboard and mouse actions on a computer:

```ts
const computerTool = anthropic.tools.computer_20241022({
  displayWidthPx: 1920,
  displayHeightPx: 1080,
  displayNumber: 0, // Optional, for X11 environments

  execute: async ({ action, coordinate, text }) => {
    // Implement your computer control logic here
    // Return the result of the action

    // Example code:
    switch (action) {
      case 'screenshot': {
        // multipart result:
        return {
          type: 'image',
          data: fs
            .readFileSync('./data/screenshot-editor.png')
            .toString('base64'),
        };
      }
      default: {
        console.log('Action:', action);
        console.log('Coordinate:', coordinate);
        console.log('Text:', text);
        return `executed ${action}`;
      }
    }
  },

  // map to tool result content for LLM consumption:
  toModelOutput(result) {
    return typeof result === 'string'
      ? [{ type: 'text', text: result }]
      : [{ type: 'image', data: result.data, mediaType: 'image/png' }];
  },
});
```

Parameters:

- `action` ('key' | 'type' | 'mouse_move' | 'left_click' | 'left_click_drag' | 'right_click' | 'middle_click' | 'double_click' | 'screenshot' | 'cursor_position'): The action to perform.
- `coordinate` (number[], optional): Required for `mouse_move` and `left_click_drag` actions. Specifies the (x, y) coordinates.
- `text` (string, optional): Required for `type` and `key` actions.

These tools can be used in conjunction with the `sonnet-3-5-sonnet-20240620` model to enable more complex interactions and tasks.

### Web Search Tool

Anthropic provides a provider-defined web search tool that gives Claude direct access to real-time web content, allowing it to answer questions with up-to-date information beyond its knowledge cutoff.

You can enable web search using the provider-defined web search tool:

```ts
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const webSearchTool = anthropic.tools.webSearch_20250305({
  maxUses: 5,
});

const result = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-opus-4-20250514'),
  prompt: 'What are the latest developments in AI?',
  tools: {
    web_search: webSearchTool,
  },
});
```

<Note>
  Web search must be enabled in your organization's [Console
  settings](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/privacy).
</Note>

#### Configuration Options

The web search tool supports several configuration options:

- **maxUses** _number_

  Maximum number of web searches Claude can perform during the conversation.

- **allowedDomains** _string[]_

  Optional list of domains that Claude is allowed to search. If provided, searches will be restricted to these domains.

- **blockedDomains** _string[]_

  Optional list of domains that Claude should avoid when searching.

- **userLocation** _object_

  Optional user location information to provide geographically relevant search results.

```ts
const webSearchTool = anthropic.tools.webSearch_20250305({
  maxUses: 3,
  allowedDomains: ['techcrunch.com', 'wired.com'],
  blockedDomains: ['example-spam-site.com'],
  userLocation: {
    type: 'approximate',
    country: 'US',
    region: 'California',
    city: 'San Francisco',
    timezone: 'America/Los_Angeles',
  },
});

const result = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-opus-4-20250514'),
  prompt: 'Find local news about technology',
  tools: {
    web_search: webSearchTool,
  },
});
```

### Web Fetch Tool

Anthropic provides a provider-defined web fetch tool that allows Claude to retrieve content from specific URLs. This is useful when you want Claude to analyze or reference content from a particular webpage or document.

You can enable web fetch using the provider-defined web fetch tool:

```ts
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-sonnet-4-0'),
  prompt:
    'What is this page about? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maglemosian_culture',
  tools: {
    web_fetch: anthropic.tools.webFetch_20250910({ maxUses: 1 }),
  },
});
```

### MCP Connectors

Anthropic supports connecting to [MCP servers](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp-connector) as part of their execution.

You can enable this feature with the `mcpServers` provider option:

```ts
import { anthropic, AnthropicProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-sonnet-4-5'),
  prompt: `Call the echo tool with "hello world". what does it respond with back?`,
  providerOptions: {
    anthropic: {
      mcpServers: [
        {
          type: 'url',
          name: 'echo',
          url: 'https://echo.mcp.inevitable.fyi/mcp',
          // optional: authorization token
          authorizationToken: mcpAuthToken,
          // optional: tool configuration
          toolConfiguration: {
            enabled: true,
            allowedTools: ['echo'],
          },
        },
      ],
    } satisfies AnthropicProviderOptions,
  },
});
```

The tool calls and results are dynamic, i.e. the input and output schemas are not known.

#### Configuration Options

The web fetch tool supports several configuration options:

- **maxUses** _number_

  The maxUses parameter limits the number of web fetches performed.

- **allowedDomains** _string[]_

  Only fetch from these domains.

- **blockedDomains** _string[]_

  Never fetch from these domains.

- **citations** _object_

  Unlike web search where citations are always enabled, citations are optional for web fetch. Set `"citations": {"enabled": true}` to enable Claude to cite specific passages from fetched documents.

- **maxContentTokens** _number_

  The maxContentTokens parameter limits the amount of content that will be included in the context.

#### Error Handling

Web search errors are handled differently depending on whether you're using streaming or non-streaming:

**Non-streaming (`generateText`, `generateObject`):**
Web search errors throw exceptions that you can catch:

```ts
try {
  const result = await generateText({
    model: anthropic('claude-opus-4-20250514'),
    prompt: 'Search for something',
    tools: {
      web_search: webSearchTool,
    },
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (error.message.includes('Web search failed')) {
    console.log('Search error:', error.message);
    // Handle search error appropriately
  }
}
```

**Streaming (`streamText`, `streamObject`):**
Web search errors are delivered as error parts in the stream:

```ts
const result = await streamText({
  model: anthropic('claude-opus-4-20250514'),
  prompt: 'Search for something',
  tools: {
    web_search: webSearchTool,
  },
});

for await (const part of result.textStream) {
  if (part.type === 'error') {
    console.log('Search error:', part.error);
    // Handle search error appropriately
  }
}
```

## Code Execution

Anthropic provides a provider-defined code execution tool that gives Claude direct access to a real Python environment allowing it to execute code to inform its responses.

You can enable code execution using the provider-defined code execution tool:

```ts
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const codeExecutionTool = anthropic.tools.codeExecution_20250825();

const result = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-opus-4-20250514'),
  prompt:
    'Calculate the mean and standard deviation of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]',
  tools: {
    code_execution: codeExecutionTool,
  },
});
```

#### Error Handling

Code execution errors are handled differently depending on whether you're using streaming or non-streaming:

**Non-streaming (`generateText`, `generateObject`):**
Code execution errors are delivered as tool result parts in the response:

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-opus-4-20250514'),
  prompt: 'Execute some Python script',
  tools: {
    code_execution: codeExecutionTool,
  },
});

const toolErrors = result.content?.filter(
  (content) => content.type === 'tool-error'
);

toolErrors?.forEach((error) => {
  console.error('Tool execution error:', {
    toolName: error.toolName,
    toolCallId: error.toolCallId,
    error: error.error,
  });
});
```

**Streaming (`streamText`, `streamObject`):**
Code execution errors are delivered as error parts in the stream:

```ts
const result = await streamText({
  model: anthropic('claude-opus-4-20250514'),
  prompt: 'Execute some Python script',
  tools: {
    code_execution: codeExecutionTool,
  },
});
for await (const part of result.textStream) {
  if (part.type === 'error') {
    console.log('Code execution error:', part.error);
    // Handle code execution error appropriately
  }
}
```

## Agent Skills

[Anthropic Agent Skills](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) enable Claude to perform specialized tasks like document processing (PPTX, DOCX, PDF, XLSX) and data analysis. Skills run in a sandboxed container and require the code execution tool to be enabled.

### Using Built-in Skills

Anthropic provides several built-in skills:

- **pptx** - Create and edit PowerPoint presentations
- **docx** - Create and edit Word documents
- **pdf** - Process and analyze PDF files
- **xlsx** - Work with Excel spreadsheets

To use skills, you need to:

1. Enable the code execution tool
2. Specify the container with skills in `providerOptions`

```ts highlight="4,9-17,19-23"
import { anthropic, AnthropicProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-sonnet-4-5'),
  tools: {
    code_execution: anthropic.tools.codeExecution_20250825(),
  },
  prompt: 'Create a presentation about renewable energy with 5 slides',
  providerOptions: {
    anthropic: {
      container: {
        skills: [
          {
            type: 'anthropic',
            skillId: 'pptx',
            version: 'latest', // optional
          },
        ],
      },
    } satisfies AnthropicProviderOptions,
  },
});
```

### Custom Skills

You can also use custom skills by specifying `type: 'custom'`:

```ts highlight="9-11"
const result = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-sonnet-4-5'),
  tools: {
    code_execution: anthropic.tools.codeExecution_20250825(),
  },
  prompt: 'Use my custom skill to process this data',
  providerOptions: {
    anthropic: {
      container: {
        skills: [
          {
            type: 'custom',
            skillId: 'my-custom-skill-id',
            version: '1.0', // optional
          },
        ],
      },
    } satisfies AnthropicProviderOptions,
  },
});
```

<Note>
  Skills use progressive context loading and execute within a sandboxed
  container with code execution capabilities.
</Note>

### PDF support

Anthropic Sonnet `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` supports reading PDF files.
You can pass PDF files as part of the message content using the `file` type:

Option 1: URL-based PDF document

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: 'What is an embedding model according to this document?',
        },
        {
          type: 'file',
          data: new URL(
            'https://github.com/vercel/ai/blob/main/examples/ai-core/data/ai.pdf?raw=true'
          ),
          mimeType: 'application/pdf',
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

Option 2: Base64-encoded PDF document

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: 'What is an embedding model according to this document?',
        },
        {
          type: 'file',
          data: fs.readFileSync('./data/ai.pdf'),
          mediaType: 'application/pdf',
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

The model will have access to the contents of the PDF file and
respond to questions about it.
The PDF file should be passed using the `data` field,
and the `mediaType` should be set to `'application/pdf'`.

### Model Capabilities

# Amazon Bedrock Provider

The Amazon Bedrock provider for the [AI SDK](/docs) contains language model support for the [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock) APIs.

## Setup

The Bedrock provider is available in the `@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock` module. You can install it with

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock" dark />
</Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="bun add @ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Prerequisites

Access to Amazon Bedrock foundation models isn't granted by default. In order to gain access to a foundation model, an IAM user with sufficient permissions needs to request access to it through the console. Once access is provided to a model, it is available for all users in the account.

See the [Model Access Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html) for more information.

### Authentication

#### Using IAM Access Key and Secret Key

**Step 1: Creating AWS Access Key and Secret Key**

To get started, you'll need to create an AWS access key and secret key. Here's how:

**Login to AWS Management Console**

- Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and log in with your AWS account credentials.

**Create an IAM User**

- Navigate to the [IAM dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) and click on "Users" in the left-hand navigation menu.
- Click on "Create user" and fill in the required details to create a new IAM user.
- Make sure to select "Programmatic access" as the access type.
- The user account needs the `AmazonBedrockFullAccess` policy attached to it.

**Create Access Key**

- Click on the "Security credentials" tab and then click on "Create access key".
- Click "Create access key" to generate a new access key pair.
- Download the `.csv` file containing the access key ID and secret access key.

**Step 2: Configuring the Access Key and Secret Key**

Within your project add a `.env` file if you don't already have one. This file will be used to set the access key and secret key as environment variables. Add the following lines to the `.env` file:

```makefile
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_REGION=YOUR_REGION
```

<Note>
  Many frameworks such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) load the `.env` file
  automatically. If you're using a different framework, you may need to load the
  `.env` file manually using a package like
  [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).
</Note>

Remember to replace `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `YOUR_REGION` with the actual values from your AWS account.

#### Using AWS SDK Credentials Chain (instance profiles, instance roles, ECS roles, EKS Service Accounts, etc.)

When using AWS SDK, the SDK will automatically use the credentials chain to determine the credentials to use. This includes instance profiles, instance roles, ECS roles, EKS Service Accounts, etc. A similar behavior is possible using the AI SDK by not specifying the `accessKeyId` and `secretAccessKey`, `sessionToken` properties in the provider settings and instead passing a `credentialProvider` property.

_Usage:_

`@aws-sdk/credential-providers` package provides a set of credential providers that can be used to create a credential provider chain.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="pnpm add @aws-sdk/credential-providers" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="npm install @aws-sdk/credential-providers" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="yarn add @aws-sdk/credential-providers" dark />
</Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="bun add @aws-sdk/credential-providers" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

```ts
import { createAmazonBedrock } from '@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock';
import { fromNodeProviderChain } from '@aws-sdk/credential-providers';

const bedrock = createAmazonBedrock({
  region: 'us-east-1',
  credentialProvider: fromNodeProviderChain(),
});
```

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `bedrock` from `@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock`:

```ts
import { bedrock } from '@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createAmazonBedrock` from `@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock` and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createAmazonBedrock } from '@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock';

const bedrock = createAmazonBedrock({
  region: 'us-east-1',
  accessKeyId: 'xxxxxxxxx',
  secretAccessKey: 'xxxxxxxxx',
  sessionToken: 'xxxxxxxxx',
});
```

<Note>
  The credentials settings fall back to environment variable defaults described
  below. These may be set by your serverless environment without your awareness,
  which can lead to merged/conflicting credential values and provider errors
  around failed authentication. If you're experiencing issues be sure you are
  explicitly specifying all settings (even if `undefined`) to avoid any
  defaults.
</Note>

You can use the following optional settings to customize the Amazon Bedrock provider instance:

- **region** _string_

  The AWS region that you want to use for the API calls.
  It uses the `AWS_REGION` environment variable by default.

- **accessKeyId** _string_

  The AWS access key ID that you want to use for the API calls.
  It uses the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` environment variable by default.

- **secretAccessKey** _string_

  The AWS secret access key that you want to use for the API calls.
  It uses the `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable by default.

- **sessionToken** _string_

  Optional. The AWS session token that you want to use for the API calls.
  It uses the `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` environment variable by default.

- **credentialProvider** _() =&gt; Promise&lt;&#123; accessKeyId: string; secretAccessKey: string; sessionToken?: string; &#125;&gt;_

  Optional. The AWS credential provider chain that you want to use for the API calls.
  It uses the specified credentials by default.

## Language Models

You can create models that call the Bedrock API using the provider instance.
The first argument is the model id, e.g. `meta.llama3-70b-instruct-v1:0`.

```ts
const model = bedrock('meta.llama3-70b-instruct-v1:0');
```

Amazon Bedrock models also support some model specific provider options that are not part of the [standard call settings](/docs/ai-sdk-core/settings).
You can pass them in the `providerOptions` argument:

```ts
const model = bedrock('anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0');

await generateText({
  model,
  providerOptions: {
    anthropic: {
      additionalModelRequestFields: { top_k: 350 },
    },
  },
});
```

Documentation for additional settings based on the selected model can be found within the [Amazon Bedrock Inference Parameter Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters.html).

You can use Amazon Bedrock language models to generate text with the `generateText` function:

```ts
import { bedrock } from '@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: bedrock('meta.llama3-70b-instruct-v1:0'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

Amazon Bedrock language models can also be used in the `streamText` function
(see [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core)).

### File Inputs

<Note type="warning">
  Amazon Bedrock supports file inputs on in combination with specific models,
  e.g. `anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0`.
</Note>

The Amazon Bedrock provider supports file inputs, e.g. PDF files.

```ts
import { bedrock } from '@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: bedrock('anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        { type: 'text', text: 'Describe the pdf in detail.' },
        {
          type: 'file',
          data: fs.readFileSync('./data/ai.pdf'),
          mediaType: 'application/pdf',
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

### Guardrails

You can use the `bedrock` provider options to utilize [Amazon Bedrock Guardrails](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/guardrails/):

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: bedrock('anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0'),
  prompt: 'Write a story about space exploration.',
  providerOptions: {
    bedrock: {
      guardrailConfig: {
        guardrailIdentifier: '1abcd2ef34gh',
        guardrailVersion: '1',
        trace: 'enabled' as const,
        streamProcessingMode: 'async',
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Tracing information will be returned in the provider metadata if you have tracing enabled.

```ts
if (result.providerMetadata?.bedrock.trace) {
  // ...
}
```

See the [Amazon Bedrock Guardrails documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails.html) for more information.

### Citations

Amazon Bedrock supports citations for document-based inputs across compatible models. When enabled:

- Some models can read documents with visual understanding, not just extracting text
- Models can cite specific parts of documents you provide, making it easier to trace information back to its source (Not Supported Yet)

```ts
import { bedrock } from '@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock';
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';
import fs from 'fs';

const result = await generateObject({
  model: bedrock('apac.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0'),
  schema: z.object({
    summary: z.string().describe('Summary of the PDF document'),
    keyPoints: z.array(z.string()).describe('Key points from the PDF'),
  }),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: 'Summarize this PDF and provide key points.',
        },
        {
          type: 'file',
          data: fs.readFileSync('./document.pdf'),
          mediaType: 'application/pdf',
          providerOptions: {
            bedrock: {
              citations: { enabled: true },
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});

console.log('Response:', result.object);
```

### Cache Points

<Note>
  Amazon Bedrock prompt caching is currently in preview release. To request
  access, visit the [Amazon Bedrock prompt caching
  page](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/prompt-caching/).
</Note>

In messages, you can use the `providerOptions` property to set cache points. Set the `bedrock` property in the `providerOptions` object to `{ cachePoint: { type: 'default' } }` to create a cache point.

Cache usage information is returned in the `providerMetadata` object`. See examples below.

<Note>
  Cache points have model-specific token minimums and limits. For example,
  Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 requires at least 1,024 tokens for a cache point and
  allows up to 4 cache points. See the [Amazon Bedrock prompt caching
  documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-caching.html)
  for details on supported models, regions, and limits.
</Note>

```ts
import { bedrock } from '@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const cyberpunkAnalysis =
  '... literary analysis of cyberpunk themes and concepts ...';

const result = await generateText({
  model: bedrock('anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'system',
      content: `You are an expert on William Gibson's cyberpunk literature and themes. You have access to the following academic analysis: ${cyberpunkAnalysis}`,
      providerOptions: {
        bedrock: { cachePoint: { type: 'default' } },
      },
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content:
        'What are the key cyberpunk themes that Gibson explores in Neuromancer?',
    },
  ],
});

console.log(result.text);
console.log(result.providerMetadata?.bedrock?.usage);
// Shows cache read/write token usage, e.g.:
// {
//   cacheReadInputTokens: 1337,
//   cacheWriteInputTokens: 42,
// }
```

Cache points also work with streaming responses:

```ts
import { bedrock } from '@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock';
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const cyberpunkAnalysis =
  '... literary analysis of cyberpunk themes and concepts ...';

const result = streamText({
  model: bedrock('anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'assistant',
      content: [
        { type: 'text', text: 'You are an expert on cyberpunk literature.' },
        { type: 'text', text: `Academic analysis: ${cyberpunkAnalysis}` },
      ],
      providerOptions: { bedrock: { cachePoint: { type: 'default' } } },
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content:
        'How does Gibson explore the relationship between humanity and technology?',
    },
  ],
});

for await (const textPart of result.textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(textPart);
}

console.log(
  'Cache token usage:',
  (await result.providerMetadata)?.bedrock?.usage
);
// Shows cache read/write token usage, e.g.:
// {
//   cacheReadInputTokens: 1337,
//   cacheWriteInputTokens: 42,
// }
```

## Reasoning

Amazon Bedrock has reasoning support for the `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219` model.

You can enable it using the `reasoningConfig` provider option and specifying a thinking budget in tokens (minimum: `1024`, maximum: `64000`).

```ts
import { bedrock } from '@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, reasoning, reasoningDetails } = await generateText({
  model: bedrock('us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0'),
  prompt: 'How many people will live in the world in 2040?',
  providerOptions: {
    bedrock: {
      reasoningConfig: { type: 'enabled', budgetTokens: 1024 },
    },
  },
});

console.log(reasoning); // reasoning text
console.log(reasoningDetails); // reasoning details including redacted reasoning
console.log(text); // text response
```

See [AI SDK UI: Chatbot](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot#reasoning) for more details
on how to integrate reasoning into your chatbot.

## Extended Context Window

Claude Sonnet 4 models on Amazon Bedrock support an extended context window of up to 1 million tokens when using the `context-1m-2025-08-07` beta feature.

```ts
import { bedrock } from '@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: bedrock('us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0'),
  prompt: 'analyze this large document...',
  providerOptions: {
    bedrock: {
      anthropicBeta: ['context-1m-2025-08-07'],
    },
  },
});
```

## Computer Use

Via Anthropic, Amazon Bedrock provides three provider-defined tools that can be used to interact with external systems:

1. **Bash Tool**: Allows running bash commands.
2. **Text Editor Tool**: Provides functionality for viewing and editing text files.
3. **Computer Tool**: Enables control of keyboard and mouse actions on a computer.

They are available via the `tools` property of the provider instance.

### Bash Tool

The Bash Tool allows running bash commands. Here's how to create and use it:

```ts
const bashTool = anthropic.tools.bash_20241022({
  execute: async ({ command, restart }) => {
    // Implement your bash command execution logic here
    // Return the result of the command execution
  },
});
```

Parameters:

- `command` (string): The bash command to run. Required unless the tool is being restarted.
- `restart` (boolean, optional): Specifying true will restart this tool.

### Text Editor Tool

The Text Editor Tool provides functionality for viewing and editing text files.

**For Claude 4 models (Opus & Sonnet):**

```ts
const textEditorTool = anthropic.tools.textEditor_20250429({
  execute: async ({
    command,
    path,
    file_text,
    insert_line,
    new_str,
    old_str,
    view_range,
  }) => {
    // Implement your text editing logic here
    // Return the result of the text editing operation
  },
});
```

**For Claude 3.5 Sonnet and earlier models:**

```ts
const textEditorTool = anthropic.tools.textEditor_20241022({
  execute: async ({
    command,
    path,
    file_text,
    insert_line,
    new_str,
    old_str,
    view_range,
  }) => {
    // Implement your text editing logic here
    // Return the result of the text editing operation
  },
});
```

Parameters:

- `command` ('view' | 'create' | 'str_replace' | 'insert' | 'undo_edit'): The command to run. Note: `undo_edit` is only available in Claude 3.5 Sonnet and earlier models.
- `path` (string): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.
- `file_text` (string, optional): Required for `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
- `insert_line` (number, optional): Required for `insert` command. The line number after which to insert the new string.
- `new_str` (string, optional): New string for `str_replace` or `insert` commands.
- `old_str` (string, optional): Required for `str_replace` command, containing the string to replace.
- `view_range` (number[], optional): Optional for `view` command to specify line range to show.

When using the Text Editor Tool, make sure to name the key in the tools object correctly:

- **Claude 4 models**: Use `str_replace_based_edit_tool`
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet and earlier**: Use `str_replace_editor`

```ts
// For Claude 4 models
const response = await generateText({
  model: bedrock('us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0'),
  prompt:
    "Create a new file called example.txt, write 'Hello World' to it, and run 'cat example.txt' in the terminal",
  tools: {
    str_replace_based_edit_tool: textEditorTool, // Claude 4 tool name
  },
});

// For Claude 3.5 Sonnet and earlier
const response = await generateText({
  model: bedrock('anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0'),
  prompt:
    "Create a new file called example.txt, write 'Hello World' to it, and run 'cat example.txt' in the terminal",
  tools: {
    str_replace_editor: textEditorTool, // Earlier models tool name
  },
});
```

### Computer Tool

The Computer Tool enables control of keyboard and mouse actions on a computer:

```ts
const computerTool = anthropic.tools.computer_20241022({
  displayWidthPx: 1920,
  displayHeightPx: 1080,
  displayNumber: 0, // Optional, for X11 environments

  execute: async ({ action, coordinate, text }) => {
    // Implement your computer control logic here
    // Return the result of the action

    // Example code:
    switch (action) {
      case 'screenshot': {
        // multipart result:
        return {
          type: 'image',
          data: fs
            .readFileSync('./data/screenshot-editor.png')
            .toString('base64'),
        };
      }
      default: {
        console.log('Action:', action);
        console.log('Coordinate:', coordinate);
        console.log('Text:', text);
        return `executed ${action}`;
      }
    }
  },

  // map to tool result content for LLM consumption:
  toModelOutput(result) {
    return typeof result === 'string'
      ? [{ type: 'text', text: result }]
      : [{ type: 'image', data: result.data, mediaType: 'image/png' }];
  },
});
```

Parameters:

- `action` ('key' | 'type' | 'mouse_move' | 'left_click' | 'left_click_drag' | 'right_click' | 'middle_click' | 'double_click' | 'screenshot' | 'cursor_position'): The action to perform.
- `coordinate` (number[], optional): Required for `mouse_move` and `left_click_drag` actions. Specifies the (x, y) coordinates.
- `text` (string, optional): Required for `type` and `key` actions.

These tools can be used in conjunction with the `anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0` model to enable more complex interactions and tasks.

<Note>
  The table above lists popular models. Please see the [Amazon Bedrock
  docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/conversation-inference-supported-models-features.html)
  for a full list of available models. The table above lists popular models. You
  can also pass any available provider model ID as a string if needed.
</Note>

## Embedding Models

You can create models that call the Bedrock API [Bedrock API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/titan-embedding-models.html)
using the `.textEmbedding()` factory method.

```ts
const model = bedrock.textEmbedding('amazon.titan-embed-text-v1');
```

Bedrock Titan embedding model amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0 supports several additional settings.
You can pass them as an options argument:

```ts
import { bedrock } from '@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock';
import { embed } from 'ai';

const model = bedrock.textEmbedding('amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0');

const { embedding } = await embed({
  model,
  value: 'sunny day at the beach',
  providerOptions: {
    bedrock: {
      dimensions: 512, // optional, number of dimensions for the embedding
      normalize: true, // optional, normalize the output embeddings
    },
  },
});
```

The following optional provider options are available for Bedrock Titan embedding models:

- **dimensions**: _number_

  The number of dimensions the output embeddings should have. The following values are accepted: 1024 (default), 512, 256.

- **normalize** _boolean_

  Flag indicating whether or not to normalize the output embeddings. Defaults to true.

### Model Capabilities

| Model                          | Default Dimensions | Custom Dimensions   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| `amazon.titan-embed-text-v1`   | 1536               | <Cross size={18} /> |
| `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0` | 1024               | <Check size={18} /> |
| `cohere.embed-english-v3`      | 1024               | <Cross size={18} /> |
| `cohere.embed-multilingual-v3` | 1024               | <Cross size={18} /> |

## Reranking Models

You can create models that call the [Bedrock Rerank API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/rerank-api.html)
using the `.reranking()` factory method.

```ts
const model = bedrock.reranking('cohere.rerank-v3-5:0');
```

You can use Amazon Bedrock reranking models to rerank documents with the `rerank` function:

```ts
import { bedrock } from '@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock';
import { rerank } from 'ai';

const documents = [
  'sunny day at the beach',
  'rainy afternoon in the city',
  'snowy night in the mountains',
];

const { ranking } = await rerank({
  model: bedrock.reranking('cohere.rerank-v3-5:0'),
  documents,
  query: 'talk about rain',
  topN: 2,
});

console.log(ranking);
// [
//   { originalIndex: 1, score: 0.9, document: 'rainy afternoon in the city' },
//   { originalIndex: 0, score: 0.3, document: 'sunny day at the beach' }
// ]
```

Amazon Bedrock reranking models support additional provider options that can be passed via `providerOptions.bedrock`:

```ts
import { bedrock } from '@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock';
import { rerank } from 'ai';

const { ranking } = await rerank({
  model: bedrock.reranking('cohere.rerank-v3-5:0'),
  documents: ['sunny day at the beach', 'rainy afternoon in the city'],
  query: 'talk about rain',
  providerOptions: {
    bedrock: {
      nextToken: 'pagination_token_here',
    },
  },
});
```

The following provider options are available:

- **nextToken** _string_

  Token for pagination of results.

- **additionalModelRequestFields** _Record&lt;string, unknown&gt;_

  Additional model-specific request fields.

### Model Capabilities

| Model                  |
| ---------------------- |
| `amazon.rerank-v1:0`   |
| `cohere.rerank-v3-5:0` |

## Image Models

You can create models that call the Bedrock API [Bedrock API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/nova/latest/userguide/image-generation.html)
using the `.image()` factory method.

For more on the Amazon Nova Canvas image model, see the [Nova Canvas
Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ai/responsible-ai/nova-canvas/overview.html).

<Note>
  The `amazon.nova-canvas-v1:0` model is available in the `us-east-1`,
  `eu-west-1`, and `ap-northeast-1` regions.
</Note>

```ts
const model = bedrock.image('amazon.nova-canvas-v1:0');
```

You can then generate images with the `experimental_generateImage` function:

```ts
import { bedrock } from '@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock';
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';

const { image } = await generateImage({
  model: bedrock.image('amazon.nova-canvas-v1:0'),
  prompt: 'A beautiful sunset over a calm ocean',
  size: '512x512',
  seed: 42,
});
```

You can also pass the `providerOptions` object to the `generateImage` function to customize the generation behavior:

```ts
import { bedrock } from '@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock';
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';

const { image } = await generateImage({
  model: bedrock.image('amazon.nova-canvas-v1:0'),
  prompt: 'A beautiful sunset over a calm ocean',
  size: '512x512',
  seed: 42,
  providerOptions: {
    bedrock: {
      quality: 'premium',
      negativeText: 'blurry, low quality',
      cfgScale: 7.5,
      style: 'PHOTOREALISM',
    },
  },
});
```

The following optional provider options are available for Amazon Nova Canvas:

- **quality** _string_

  The quality level for image generation. Accepts `'standard'` or `'premium'`.

- **negativeText** _string_

  Text describing what you don't want in the generated image.

- **cfgScale** _number_

  Controls how closely the generated image adheres to the prompt. Higher values result in images that are more closely aligned to the prompt.

- **style** _string_

  Predefined visual style for image generation.
  Accepts one of:
  `3D_ANIMATED_FAMILY_FILM` · `DESIGN_SKETCH` · `FLAT_VECTOR_ILLUSTRATION` ·
  `GRAPHIC_NOVEL_ILLUSTRATION` · `MAXIMALISM` · `MIDCENTURY_RETRO` ·
  `PHOTOREALISM` · `SOFT_DIGITAL_PAINTING`.

Documentation for additional settings can be found within the [Amazon Bedrock
User Guide for Amazon Nova
Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/nova/latest/userguide/image-gen-req-resp-structure.html).

### Image Model Settings

You can customize the generation behavior with optional options:

```ts
await generateImage({
  model: bedrock.image('amazon.nova-canvas-v1:0'),
  prompt: 'A beautiful sunset over a calm ocean',
  size: '512x512',
  seed: 42,
  maxImagesPerCall: 1, // Maximum number of images to generate per API call
});
```

- **maxImagesPerCall** _number_

  Override the maximum number of images generated per API call. Default can vary
  by model, with 5 as a common default.

### Model Capabilities

The Amazon Nova Canvas model supports custom sizes with constraints as follows:

- Each side must be between 320-4096 pixels, inclusive.
- Each side must be evenly divisible by 16.
- The aspect ratio must be between 1:4 and 4:1. That is, one side can't be more than 4 times longer than the other side.
- The total pixel count must be less than 4,194,304.

For more, see [Image generation access and
usage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/nova/latest/userguide/image-gen-access.html).

| Model                     | Sizes                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `amazon.nova-canvas-v1:0` | Custom sizes: 320-4096px per side (must be divisible by 16), aspect ratio 1:4 to 4:1, max 4.2M pixels |

## Response Headers

The Amazon Bedrock provider will return the response headers associated with
network requests made of the Bedrock servers.

```ts
import { bedrock } from '@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: bedrock('meta.llama3-70b-instruct-v1:0'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});

console.log(result.response.headers);
```

Below is sample output where you can see the `x-amzn-requestid` header. This can
be useful for correlating Bedrock API calls with requests made by the AI SDK:

```js highlight="6"
{
  connection: 'keep-alive',
  'content-length': '2399',
  'content-type': 'application/json',
  date: 'Fri, 07 Feb 2025 04:28:30 GMT',
  'x-amzn-requestid': 'c9f3ace4-dd5d-49e5-9807-39aedfa47c8e'
}
```

This information is also available with `streamText`:

```ts
import { bedrock } from '@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock';
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = streamText({
  model: bedrock('meta.llama3-70b-instruct-v1:0'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
for await (const textPart of result.textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(textPart);
}
console.log('Response headers:', (await result.response).headers);
```

With sample output as:

```js highlight="6"
{
  connection: 'keep-alive',
  'content-type': 'application/vnd.amazon.eventstream',
  date: 'Fri, 07 Feb 2025 04:33:37 GMT',
  'transfer-encoding': 'chunked',
  'x-amzn-requestid': 'a976e3fc-0e45-4241-9954-b9bdd80ab407'
}
```

## Migrating to `@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock` 2.x

The Amazon Bedrock provider was rewritten in version 2.x to remove the
dependency on the `@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime` package.

The `bedrockOptions` provider setting previously available has been removed. If
you were using the `bedrockOptions` object, you should now use the `region`,
`accessKeyId`, `secretAccessKey`, and `sessionToken` settings directly instead.

Note that you may need to set all of these explicitly, e.g. even if you're not
using `sessionToken`, set it to `undefined`. If you're running in a serverless
environment, there may be default environment variables set by your containing
environment that the Amazon Bedrock provider will then pick up and could
conflict with the ones you're intending to use.

# Groq Provider

The [Groq](https://groq.com/) provider contains language model support for the Groq API.

## Setup

The Groq provider is available via the `@ai-sdk/groq` module.
You can install it with

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/groq" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/groq" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/groq" dark />
</Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="bun add @ai-sdk/groq" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `groq` from `@ai-sdk/groq`:

```ts
import { groq } from '@ai-sdk/groq';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createGroq` from `@ai-sdk/groq`
and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createGroq } from '@ai-sdk/groq';

const groq = createGroq({
  // custom settings
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the Groq provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls, e.g. to use proxy servers.
  The default prefix is `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header.
  It defaults to the `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  Defaults to the global `fetch` function.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

## Language Models

You can create [Groq models](https://console.groq.com/docs/models) using a provider instance.
The first argument is the model id, e.g. `gemma2-9b-it`.

```ts
const model = groq('gemma2-9b-it');
```

### Reasoning Models

Groq offers several reasoning models such as `qwen-qwq-32b` and `deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b`.
You can configure how the reasoning is exposed in the generated text by using the `reasoningFormat` option.
It supports the options `parsed`, `hidden`, and `raw`.

```ts
import { groq } from '@ai-sdk/groq';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: groq('qwen/qwen3-32b'),
  providerOptions: {
    groq: {
      reasoningFormat: 'parsed',
      reasoningEffort: 'default',
      parallelToolCalls: true, // Enable parallel function calling (default: true)
      user: 'user-123', // Unique identifier for end-user (optional)
      serviceTier: 'flex', // Use flex tier for higher throughput (optional)
    },
  },
  prompt: 'How many "r"s are in the word "strawberry"?',
});
```

The following optional provider options are available for Groq language models:

- **reasoningFormat** _'parsed' | 'raw' | 'hidden'_

  Controls how reasoning is exposed in the generated text. Only supported by reasoning models like `qwen-qwq-32b` and `deepseek-r1-distill-*` models.

  For a complete list of reasoning models and their capabilities, see [Groq's reasoning models documentation](https://console.groq.com/docs/reasoning).

- **reasoningEffort** _'low' | 'meduim' | 'high' | 'none' | 'default'_

  Controls the level of effort the model will put into reasoning.

  - `qwen/qwen3-32b`
    - Supported values:
      - `none`: Disable reasoning. The model will not use any reasoning tokens.
      - `default`: Enable reasoning.
  - `gpt-oss20b/gpt-oss120b`
    - Supported values:
      - `low`: Use a low level of reasoning effort.
      - `medium`: Use a medium level of reasoning effort.
      - `high`: Use a high level of reasoning effort.

  Defaults to `default` for `qwen/qwen3-32b.`

- **structuredOutputs** _boolean_

  Whether to use structured outputs.

  Defaults to `true`.

  When enabled, object generation will use the `json_schema` format instead of `json_object` format, providing more reliable structured outputs.

- **parallelToolCalls** _boolean_

  Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use. Defaults to `true`.

- **user** _string_

  A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help with monitoring and abuse detection.

- **serviceTier** _'on_demand' | 'flex' | 'auto'_

  Service tier for the request. Defaults to `'on_demand'`.

  - `'on_demand'`: Default tier with consistent performance and fairness
  - `'flex'`: Higher throughput tier (10x rate limits) optimized for workloads that can handle occasional request failures
  - `'auto'`: Uses on_demand rate limits first, then falls back to flex tier if exceeded

  For more details about service tiers and their benefits, see [Groq's Flex Processing documentation](https://console.groq.com/docs/flex-processing).

<Note>Only Groq reasoning models support the `reasoningFormat` option.</Note>

#### Structured Outputs

Structured outputs are enabled by default for Groq models.
You can disable them by setting the `structuredOutputs` option to `false`.

```ts
import { groq } from '@ai-sdk/groq';
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const result = await generateObject({
  model: groq('moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct-0905'),
  schema: z.object({
    recipe: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      ingredients: z.array(z.string()),
      instructions: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a simple pasta recipe.',
});

console.log(JSON.stringify(result.object, null, 2));
```

You can disable structured outputs for models that don't support them:

```ts highlight="9"
import { groq } from '@ai-sdk/groq';
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const result = await generateObject({
  model: groq('gemma2-9b-it'),
  providerOptions: {
    groq: {
      structuredOutputs: false,
    },
  },
  schema: z.object({
    recipe: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      ingredients: z.array(z.string()),
      instructions: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a simple pasta recipe in JSON format.',
});

console.log(JSON.stringify(result.object, null, 2));
```

<Note type="warning">
  Structured outputs are only supported by newer Groq models like
  `moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct-0905`. For unsupported models, you can disable
  structured outputs by setting `structuredOutputs: false`. When disabled, Groq
  uses the `json_object` format which requires the word "JSON" to be included in
  your messages.
</Note>

### Example

You can use Groq language models to generate text with the `generateText` function:

```ts
import { groq } from '@ai-sdk/groq';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: groq('gemma2-9b-it'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

### Image Input

Groq's multi-modal models like `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` support image inputs. You can include images in your messages using either URLs or base64-encoded data:

```ts
import { groq } from '@ai-sdk/groq';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: groq('meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        { type: 'text', text: 'What do you see in this image?' },
        {
          type: 'image',
          image: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

You can also use base64-encoded images:

```ts
import { groq } from '@ai-sdk/groq';
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';

const imageData = readFileSync('path/to/image.jpg', 'base64');

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: groq('meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        { type: 'text', text: 'Describe this image in detail.' },
        {
          type: 'image',
          image: `data:image/jpeg;base64,${imageData}`,
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

<Note>
  The tables above list the most commonly used models. Please see the [Groq
  docs](https://console.groq.com/docs/models) for a complete list of available
  models. You can also pass any available provider model ID as a string if
  needed.
</Note>

## Browser Search Tool

Groq provides a browser search tool that offers interactive web browsing capabilities. Unlike traditional web search, browser search navigates websites interactively, providing more detailed and comprehensive results.

### Supported Models

Browser search is only available for these specific models:

- `openai/gpt-oss-20b`
- `openai/gpt-oss-120b`

<Note type="warning">
  Browser search will only work with the supported models listed above. Using it
  with other models will generate a warning and the tool will be ignored.
</Note>

### Basic Usage

```ts
import { groq } from '@ai-sdk/groq';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: groq('openai/gpt-oss-120b'), // Must use supported model
  prompt:
    'What are the latest developments in AI? Please search for recent news.',
  tools: {
    browser_search: groq.tools.browserSearch({}),
  },
  toolChoice: 'required', // Ensure the tool is used
});

console.log(result.text);
```

### Streaming Example

```ts
import { groq } from '@ai-sdk/groq';
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = streamText({
  model: groq('openai/gpt-oss-120b'),
  prompt: 'Search for the latest tech news and summarize it.',
  tools: {
    browser_search: groq.tools.browserSearch({}),
  },
  toolChoice: 'required',
});

for await (const delta of result.fullStream) {
  if (delta.type === 'text-delta') {
    process.stdout.write(delta.text);
  }
}
```

### Key Features

- **Interactive Browsing**: Navigates websites like a human user
- **Comprehensive Results**: More detailed than traditional search snippets
- **Server-side Execution**: Runs on Groq's infrastructure, no setup required
- **Powered by Exa**: Uses Exa search engine for optimal results
- **Currently Free**: Available at no additional charge during beta

### Best Practices

- Use `toolChoice: 'required'` to ensure the browser search is activated
- Only supported on `openai/gpt-oss-20b` and `openai/gpt-oss-120b` models
- The tool works automatically - no configuration parameters needed
- Server-side execution means no additional API keys or setup required

### Model Validation

The provider automatically validates model compatibility:

```ts
// ✅ Supported - will work
const result = await generateText({
  model: groq('openai/gpt-oss-120b'),
  tools: { browser_search: groq.tools.browserSearch({}) },
});

// ❌ Unsupported - will show warning and ignore tool
const result = await generateText({
  model: groq('gemma2-9b-it'),
  tools: { browser_search: groq.tools.browserSearch({}) },
});
// Warning: "Browser search is only supported on models: openai/gpt-oss-20b, openai/gpt-oss-120b"
```

<Note>
  For more details about browser search capabilities and limitations, see the
  [Groq Browser Search
  Documentation](https://console.groq.com/docs/browser-search).
</Note>

## Transcription Models

You can create models that call the [Groq transcription API](https://console.groq.com/docs/speech-to-text)
using the `.transcription()` factory method.

The first argument is the model id e.g. `whisper-large-v3`.

```ts
const model = groq.transcription('whisper-large-v3');
```

You can also pass additional provider-specific options using the `providerOptions` argument. For example, supplying the input language in ISO-639-1 (e.g. `en`) format will improve accuracy and latency.

```ts highlight="6"
import { experimental_transcribe as transcribe } from 'ai';
import { groq } from '@ai-sdk/groq';
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';

const result = await transcribe({
  model: groq.transcription('whisper-large-v3'),
  audio: await readFile('audio.mp3'),
  providerOptions: { groq: { language: 'en' } },
});
```

The following provider options are available:

- **timestampGranularities** _string[]_
  The granularity of the timestamps in the transcription.
  Defaults to `['segment']`.
  Possible values are `['word']`, `['segment']`, and `['word', 'segment']`.
  Note: There is no additional latency for segment timestamps, but generating word timestamps incurs additional latency.

- **language** _string_
  The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in ISO-639-1 format (e.g. 'en') will improve accuracy and latency.
  Optional.

- **prompt** _string_
  An optional text to guide the model's style or continue a previous audio segment. The prompt should match the audio language.
  Optional.

- **temperature** _number_
  The sampling temperature, between 0 and 1. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. If set to 0, the model will use log probability to automatically increase the temperature until certain thresholds are hit.
  Defaults to 0.
  Optional.

### Model Capabilities

| Model                        | Transcription       | Duration            | Segments            | Language            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| `whisper-large-v3`           | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> |
| `whisper-large-v3-turbo`     | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> |
| `distil-whisper-large-v3-en` | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> |

# Fal Provider

[Fal AI](https://fal.ai/) provides a generative media platform for developers with lightning-fast inference capabilities. Their platform offers optimized performance for running diffusion models, with speeds up to 4x faster than alternatives.

## Setup

The Fal provider is available via the `@ai-sdk/fal` module. You can install it with

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/fal" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/fal" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/fal" dark />
</Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="bun add @ai-sdk/fal" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `fal` from `@ai-sdk/fal`:

```ts
import { fal } from '@ai-sdk/fal';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createFal` and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createFal } from '@ai-sdk/fal';

const fal = createFal({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key', // optional, defaults to FAL_API_KEY environment variable, falling back to FAL_KEY
  baseURL: 'custom-url', // optional
  headers: {
    /* custom headers */
  }, // optional
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the Fal provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls, e.g. to use proxy servers.
  The default prefix is `https://fal.run`.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header.
  It defaults to the `FAL_API_KEY` environment variable, falling back to `FAL_KEY`.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

## Image Models

You can create Fal image models using the `.image()` factory method.
For more on image generation with the AI SDK see [generateImage()](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-image).

### Basic Usage

```ts
import { fal } from '@ai-sdk/fal';
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';
import fs from 'fs';

const { image, providerMetadata } = await generateImage({
  model: fal.image('fal-ai/flux/dev'),
  prompt: 'A serene mountain landscape at sunset',
});

const filename = `image-${Date.now()}.png`;
fs.writeFileSync(filename, image.uint8Array);
console.log(`Image saved to ${filename}`);
```

Fal image models may return additional information for the images and the request.

Here are some examples of properties that may be set for each image

```js
providerMetadata.fal.images[0].nsfw; // boolean, image is not safe for work
providerMetadata.fal.images[0].width; // number, image width
providerMetadata.fal.images[0].height; // number, image height
providerMetadata.fal.images[0].content_type; // string, mime type of the image
```

### Model Capabilities

Fal offers many models optimized for different use cases. Here are a few popular examples. For a full list of models, see the [Fal AI Search Page](https://fal.ai/explore/search).

  },
});
```

### Provider Options

Fal image models support flexible provider options through the `providerOptions.fal` object. You can pass any parameters supported by the specific Fal model's API. Common options include:

- **imageUrl** - Reference image URL for image-to-image generation
- **strength** - Controls how much the output differs from the input image
- **guidanceScale** - Controls adherence to the prompt (range: 1-20)
- **numInferenceSteps** - Number of denoising steps (range: 1-50)
- **enableSafetyChecker** - Enable/disable safety filtering
- **outputFormat** - Output format: 'jpeg' or 'png'
- **syncMode** - Wait for completion before returning response
- **acceleration** - Speed of generation: 'none', 'regular', or 'high'
- **safetyTolerance** - Content safety filtering level (1-6, where 1 is strictest)

<Note type="warning">
  **Deprecation Notice**: snake_case parameter names (e.g., `image_url`,
  `guidance_scale`) are deprecated and will be removed in `@ai-sdk/fal` v2.0.
  Please use camelCase names (e.g., `imageUrl`, `guidanceScale`) instead.
</Note>

Refer to the [Fal AI model documentation](https://fal.ai/models) for model-specific parameters.

### Advanced Features

Fal's platform offers several advanced capabilities:

- **Real-time Infrastructure**: Enable new user experiences with fast inference times
- **Scalable Architecture**: Scale to thousands of GPUs when needed

For more details about Fal's capabilities and features, visit the [Fal AI documentation](https://fal.ai/docs).

## Transcription Models

You can create models that call the [Fal transcription API](https://docs.fal.ai/guides/convert-speech-to-text)
using the `.transcription()` factory method.

The first argument is the model id without the `fal-ai/` prefix e.g. `wizper`.

```ts
const model = fal.transcription('wizper');
```

You can also pass additional provider-specific options using the `providerOptions` argument. For example, supplying the `batchSize` option will increase the number of audio chunks processed in parallel.

```ts highlight="6"
import { experimental_transcribe as transcribe } from 'ai';
import { fal } from '@ai-sdk/fal';
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';

const result = await transcribe({
  model: fal.transcription('wizper'),
  audio: await readFile('audio.mp3'),
  providerOptions: { fal: { batchSize: 10 } },
});
```

The following provider options are available:

- **language** _string_
  Language of the audio file. If set to null, the language will be automatically detected.
  Accepts ISO language codes like 'en', 'fr', 'zh', etc.
  Optional.

- **diarize** _boolean_
  Whether to diarize the audio file (identify different speakers).
  Defaults to true.
  Optional.

- **chunkLevel** _string_
  Level of the chunks to return. Either 'segment' or 'word'.
  Default value: "segment"
  Optional.

- **version** _string_
  Version of the model to use. All models are Whisper large variants.
  Default value: "3"
  Optional.

- **batchSize** _number_
  Batch size for processing.
  Default value: 64
  Optional.

- **numSpeakers** _number_
  Number of speakers in the audio file. If not provided, the number of speakers will be automatically detected.
  Optional.

### Model Capabilities

| Model     | Transcription       | Duration            | Segments            | Language            |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |

### Basic Usage

```ts
import { experimental_generateSpeech as generateSpeech } from 'ai';
import { fal } from '@ai-sdk/fal';

const result = await generateSpeech({
  model: fal.speech('fal-ai/minimax/speech-02-hd'),

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `deepinfra` from `@ai-sdk/deepinfra`:

```ts
import { deepinfra } from '@ai-sdk/deepinfra';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createDeepInfra` from `@ai-sdk/deepinfra` and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createDeepInfra } from '@ai-sdk/deepinfra';

const deepinfra = createDeepInfra({
  apiKey: process.env.DEEPINFRA_API_KEY ?? '',
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the DeepInfra provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls, e.g. to use proxy servers.
  The default prefix is `https://api.deepinfra.com/v1`.

  Note: Language models and embeddings use OpenAI-compatible endpoints at `{baseURL}/openai`,
  while image models use `{baseURL}/inference`.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header. It defaults to
  the `DEEPINFRA_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  Defaults to the global `fetch` function.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

## Language Models

You can create language models using a provider instance. The first argument is the model ID, for example:

```ts
import { deepinfra } from '@ai-sdk/deepinfra';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: deepinfra('meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

DeepInfra language models can also be used in the `streamText` function (see [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core)).

</Note>

## Image Models

You can create DeepInfra image models using the `.image()` factory method.
For more on image generation with the AI SDK see [generateImage()](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-image).

```ts
import { deepinfra } from '@ai-sdk/deepinfra';
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';

const { image } = await generateImage({
  model: deepinfra.image('stabilityai/sd3.5'),
  prompt: 'A futuristic cityscape at sunset',
  aspectRatio: '16:9',
});
```

<Note>
  Model support for `size` and `aspectRatio` parameters varies by model. Please
  check the individual model documentation on [DeepInfra's models
  page](https://deepinfra.com/models/text-to-image) for supported options and
  additional parameters.
</Note>

### Model-specific options

You can pass model-specific parameters using the `providerOptions.deepinfra` field:

```ts
import { deepinfra } from '@ai-sdk/deepinfra';
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';

const { image } = await generateImage({
  model: deepinfra.image('stabilityai/sd3.5'),
  prompt: 'A futuristic cityscape at sunset',
  aspectRatio: '16:9',
  providerOptions: {
    deepinfra: {
      num_inference_steps: 30, // Control the number of denoising steps (1-50)
    },
  },
});
```

### Model Capabilities

For models supporting aspect ratios, the following ratios are typically supported:
`1:1 (default), 16:9, 1:9, 3:2, 2:3, 4:5, 5:4, 9:16, 9:21`

For models supporting size parameters, dimensions must typically be:

- Multiples of 32
- Width and height between 256 and 1440 pixels
- Default size is 1024x1024

  prompt: 'A serene mountain landscape at sunset',
});

const filename = `image-${Date.now()}.png`;
writeFileSync(filename, image.uint8Array);
console.log(`Image saved to ${filename}`);
```

### Model Capabilities

Black Forest Labs offers many models optimized for different use cases. Here are a few popular examples. For a full list of models, see the [Black Forest Labs Models Page](https://bfl.ai/models).

| Model                | Description                                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flux-kontext-pro`   | FLUX.1 Kontext [pro] handles both text and reference images as inputs, enabling targeted edits and complex transformations |
| `flux-kontext-max`   | FLUX.1 Kontext [max] with improved prompt adherence and typography generation                                              |
| `flux-pro-1.1-ultra` | Ultra-fast, ultra high-resolution image creation                                                                           |
| `flux-pro-1.1`       | Fast, high-quality image generation from text.                                                                             |

Black Forest Labs models support aspect ratios from 3:7 (portrait) to 7:3 (landscape).

#### Modify Image

Transform existing images using text prompts.

```ts
import {
  blackForestLabs,
  BlackForestLabsImageProviderOptions,
} from '@ai-sdk/black-forest-labs';
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';

// Example: Modify existing image
await generateImage({
  model: blackForestLabs.image('flux-kontext-pro'),
  prompt: 'Put a donut next to the flour.',
  providerOptions: {
    blackForestLabs: {
      inputImage: '<base64 converted image>',
    } satisfies BlackForestLabsImageProviderOptions,
  },
});
```

### Provider Options

Black Forest Labs image models support flexible provider options through the `providerOptions.blackForestLabs` object. You can pass any parameters supported by the specific endpoint's API. The supported parameters depend on the used model ID:

- **imagePrompt** - Base64-encoded image to use as additional visual context for generation
- **imagePromptStrength** - Strength of the image prompt influence on generation (0.0 to 1.0)
- **inputImage** - Base64 encoded image or URL of image to use as reference. Supports up to 20MB or 20 megapixels.
- **outputFormat** - Desired format of the output image. Can be “jpeg” or “png”.
- **promptUpsampling** - If true, performs upsampling on the prompt
- **raw** - Enable raw mode for more natural, authentic aesthetics
- **safetyTolerance** - Moderation level for inputs and outputs. Value ranges from 0 (most strict) to 6 (more permissive).
- **webhookSecret** - Secret for webhook signature verification, sent in the `X-Webhook-Secret` header.
- **webhookUrl** - URL for asynchronous completion notification. Must be a valid HTTP/HTTPS URL.
- **pollIntervalMillis** - Interval in milliseconds between polling attempts (default 500ms)
- **pollTimeoutMillis** - Overall timeout in milliseconds for polling before timing out (default 60s)
- **width** - Output width in pixels for models that support explicit dimensions. Range 256–1920, default 1024. When set, this overrides any width derived from `size`.
- **height** - Output height in pixels for models that support explicit dimensions. Range 256–1920, default 768. When set, this overrides any height derived from `size`.
- **steps** - Number of inference steps. Higher values may improve quality but increase generation time
- **guidance** - Guidance scale for generation. Higher values follow the prompt more closely
- **inputImage2 … inputImage10** - Additional reference images (base64 string or URL) for models that support multiple inputs, used alongside `inputImage`.

### Regional Endpoints

By default, requests are sent to `https://api.bfl.ai/v1`. You can select a [regional endpoint](https://docs.bfl.ai/api_integration/integration_guidelines#regional-endpoints) by setting `baseURL` when creating the provider instance:

```ts
import { createBlackForestLabs } from '@ai-sdk/black-forest-labs';

const blackForestLabs = createBlackForestLabs({
  baseURL: 'https://api.eu.bfl.ai/v1', // or https://api.us.bfl.ai/v1
});
```

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header.
  It defaults to the `LMNT_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  Defaults to the global `fetch` function.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

## Speech Models

You can create models that call the [LMNT speech API](https://docs.lmnt.com/api-reference/speech/synthesize-speech-bytes)
using the `.speech()` factory method.

The first argument is the model id e.g. `aurora`.

```ts
const model = lmnt.speech('aurora');
```

You can also pass additional provider-specific options using the `providerOptions` argument. For example, supplying a voice to use for the generated audio.

```ts highlight="6"
import { experimental_generateSpeech as generateSpeech } from 'ai';
import { lmnt } from '@ai-sdk/lmnt';

const result = await generateSpeech({
  model: lmnt.speech('aurora'),
  text: 'Hello, world!',
  language: 'en', // Standardized language parameter
});
```

### Provider Options

The LMNT provider accepts the following options:

- **model** _'aurora' | 'blizzard'_

  The LMNT model to use. Defaults to `'aurora'`.

- **language** _'auto' | 'en' | 'es' | 'pt' | 'fr' | 'de' | 'zh' | 'ko' | 'hi' | 'ja' | 'ru' | 'it' | 'tr'_

  The language to use for speech synthesis. Defaults to `'auto'`.

- **format** _'aac' | 'mp3' | 'mulaw' | 'raw' | 'wav'_

  The audio format to return. Defaults to `'mp3'`.

- **sampleRate** _number_

  The sample rate of the audio in Hz. Defaults to `24000`.

- **speed** _number_

  The speed of the speech. Must be between 0.25 and 2. Defaults to `1`.

- **seed** _number_

  An optional seed for deterministic generation.

- **conversational** _boolean_

  Whether to use a conversational style. Defaults to `false`.

- **length** _number_

  Maximum length of the audio in seconds. Maximum value is 300.

- **topP** _number_

  Top-p sampling parameter. Must be between 0 and 1. Defaults to `1`.

- **temperature** _number_

  Temperature parameter for sampling. Must be at least 0. Defaults to `1`.

### Model Capabilities

| Model      | Instructions        |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| `aurora`   | <Check size={18} /> |

# Google Generative AI Provider

The [Google Generative AI](https://ai.google.dev) provider contains language and embedding model support for
the [Google Generative AI](https://ai.google.dev/api/rest) APIs.

## Setup

The Google provider is available in the `@ai-sdk/google` module. You can install it with

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/google" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/google" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/google" dark />
</Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="bun add @ai-sdk/google" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `google` from `@ai-sdk/google`:

```ts
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createGoogleGenerativeAI` from `@ai-sdk/google` and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createGoogleGenerativeAI } from '@ai-sdk/google';

const google = createGoogleGenerativeAI({
  // custom settings
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the Google Generative AI provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls, e.g. to use proxy servers.
  The default prefix is `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta`.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `x-goog-api-key` header.
  It defaults to the `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  Defaults to the global `fetch` function.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

## Language Models

You can create models that call the [Google Generative AI API](https://ai.google.dev/api/rest) using the provider instance.
The first argument is the model id, e.g. `gemini-2.5-flash`.
The models support tool calls and some have multi-modal capabilities.

```ts
const model = google('gemini-2.5-flash');
```

You can use Google Generative AI language models to generate text with the `generateText` function:

```ts
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: google('gemini-2.5-flash'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

Google Generative AI language models can also be used in the `streamText`, `generateObject`, and `streamObject` functions
(see [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core)).

Google Generative AI also supports some model specific settings that are not part of the [standard call settings](/docs/ai-sdk-core/settings).
You can pass them as an options argument:

```ts
const model = google('gemini-2.5-flash');

await generateText({
  model,
  providerOptions: {
    google: {
      safetySettings: [
        {
          category: 'HARM_CATEGORY_UNSPECIFIED',
          threshold: 'BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE',
        },
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

The following optional provider options are available for Google Generative AI models:

- **cachedContent** _string_

  Optional. The name of the cached content used as context to serve the prediction.
  Format: cachedContents/\{cachedContent\}

- **structuredOutputs** _boolean_

  Optional. Enable structured output. Default is true.

  This is useful when the JSON Schema contains elements that are
  not supported by the OpenAPI schema version that
  Google Generative AI uses. You can use this to disable
  structured outputs if you need to.

  See [Troubleshooting: Schema Limitations](#schema-limitations) for more details.

- **safetySettings** _Array\<\{ category: string; threshold: string \}\>_

  Optional. Safety settings for the model.

  - **category** _string_

    The category of the safety setting. Can be one of the following:

    - `HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH`
    - `HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT`
    - `HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT`
    - `HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT`

  - **threshold** _string_

    The threshold of the safety setting. Can be one of the following:

    - `HARM_BLOCK_THRESHOLD_UNSPECIFIED`
    - `BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE`
    - `BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE`
    - `BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH`
    - `BLOCK_NONE`

- **responseModalities** _string[]_
  The modalities to use for the response. The following modalities are supported: `TEXT`, `IMAGE`. When not defined or empty, the model defaults to returning only text.

- **thinkingConfig** _\{ thinkingLevel?: 'low' | 'high'; thinkingBudget?: number; includeThoughts?: boolean \}_

  Optional. Configuration for the model's thinking process. Only supported by specific [Google Generative AI models](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking).

  - **thinkingLevel** _'low' | 'high'_

    Optional. Controls the thinking depth for Gemini 3 models. Use 'low' for faster responses or 'high' for deeper reasoning. Only supported by Gemini 3 models (`gemini-3-pro-preview` and later).

  - **thinkingBudget** _number_

    Optional. Gives the model guidance on the number of thinking tokens it can use when generating a response. Setting it to 0 disables thinking, if the model supports it.
    For more information about the possible value ranges for each model see [Google Generative AI thinking documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking#set-budget).

    <Note>
      This option is for Gemini 2.5 models. Gemini 3 models should use
      `thinkingLevel` instead.
    </Note>

  - **includeThoughts** _boolean_

    Optional. If set to true, thought summaries are returned, which are synthisized versions of the model's raw thoughts and offer insights into the model's internal reasoning process.

- **imageConfig** _\{ aspectRatio: string \}_

  Optional. Configuration for the models image generation. Only supported by specific [Google Generative AI models](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-generation).

  - **aspectRatio** _string_

  Model defaults to generate 1:1 squares, or to matching the output image size to that of your input image. Can be one of the following:

  - 1:1
  - 2:3
  - 3:2
  - 3:4
  - 4:3
  - 4:5
  - 5:4
  - 9:16
  - 16:9
  - 21:9

### Thinking

The Gemini 2.5 and Gemini 3 series models use an internal "thinking process" that significantly improves their reasoning and multi-step planning abilities, making them highly effective for complex tasks such as coding, advanced mathematics, and data analysis. For more information see [Google Generative AI thinking documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking).

#### Gemini 3 Models

For Gemini 3 models, use the `thinkingLevel` parameter to control the depth of reasoning:

```ts
import { google, GoogleGenerativeAIProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const model = google('gemini-3-pro-preview');

const { text, reasoning } = await generateText({
  model: model,
  prompt: 'What is the sum of the first 10 prime numbers?',
  providerOptions: {
    google: {
      thinkingConfig: {
        thinkingLevel: 'high',
        includeThoughts: true,
      },
    } satisfies GoogleGenerativeAIProviderOptions,
  },
});

console.log(text);

console.log(reasoning); // Reasoning summary
```

#### Gemini 2.5 Models

For Gemini 2.5 models, use the `thinkingBudget` parameter to control the number of thinking tokens:

```ts
import { google, GoogleGenerativeAIProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const model = google('gemini-2.5-flash');

const { text, reasoning } = await generateText({
  model: model,
  prompt: 'What is the sum of the first 10 prime numbers?',
  providerOptions: {
    google: {
      thinkingConfig: {
        thinkingBudget: 8192,
        includeThoughts: true,
      },
    } satisfies GoogleGenerativeAIProviderOptions,
  },
});

console.log(text);

console.log(reasoning); // Reasoning summary
```

### File Inputs

The Google Generative AI provider supports file inputs, e.g. PDF files.

```ts
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: google('gemini-2.5-flash'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: 'What is an embedding model according to this document?',
        },
        {
          type: 'file',
          data: fs.readFileSync('./data/ai.pdf'),
          mediaType: 'application/pdf',
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

You can also use YouTube URLs directly:

```ts
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: google('gemini-2.5-flash'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: 'Summarize this video',
        },
        {
          type: 'file',
          data: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ',
          mediaType: 'video/mp4',
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

<Note>
  The AI SDK will automatically download URLs if you pass them as data, except
  for `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/files/` and YouTube
  URLs. You can use the Google Generative AI Files API to upload larger files to
  that location. YouTube URLs (public or unlisted videos) are supported directly
  - you can specify one YouTube video URL per request.
</Note>

See [File Parts](/docs/foundations/prompts#file-parts) for details on how to use files in prompts.

### Cached Content

Google Generative AI supports both explicit and implicit caching to help reduce costs on repetitive content.

#### Implicit Caching

Gemini 2.5 models automatically provide cache cost savings without needing to create an explicit cache. When you send requests that share common prefixes with previous requests, you'll receive a 75% token discount on cached content.

To maximize cache hits with implicit caching:

- Keep content at the beginning of requests consistent
- Add variable content (like user questions) at the end of prompts
- Ensure requests meet minimum token requirements:
  - Gemini 2.5 Flash: 1024 tokens minimum
  - Gemini 2.5 Pro: 2048 tokens minimum

```ts
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

// Structure prompts with consistent content at the beginning
const baseContext =
  'You are a cooking assistant with expertise in Italian cuisine. Here are 1000 lasagna recipes for reference...';

const { text: veggieLasagna } = await generateText({
  model: google('gemini-2.5-pro'),
  prompt: `${baseContext}\n\nWrite a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.`,
});

// Second request with same prefix - eligible for cache hit
const { text: meatLasagna, providerMetadata } = await generateText({
  model: google('gemini-2.5-pro'),
  prompt: `${baseContext}\n\nWrite a meat lasagna recipe for 12 people.`,
});

// Check cached token count in usage metadata
console.log('Cached tokens:', providerMetadata.google?.usageMetadata);
// e.g.
// {
//   groundingMetadata: null,
//   safetyRatings: null,
//   usageMetadata: {
//     cachedContentTokenCount: 2027,
//     thoughtsTokenCount: 702,
//     promptTokenCount: 2152,
//     candidatesTokenCount: 710,
//     totalTokenCount: 3564
//   }
// }
```

<Note>
  Usage metadata was added to `providerMetadata` in `@ai-sdk/google@1.2.23`. If
  you are using an older version, usage metadata is available in the raw HTTP
  `response` body returned as part of the return value from `generateText`.
</Note>

#### Explicit Caching

For guaranteed cost savings, you can still use explicit caching with Gemini 2.5 and 2.0 models. See the [models page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models) to check if caching is supported for the used model:

```ts
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { GoogleAICacheManager } from '@google/generative-ai/server';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const cacheManager = new GoogleAICacheManager(
  process.env.GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY
);

const model = 'gemini-2.5-pro';

const { name: cachedContent } = await cacheManager.create({
  model,
  contents: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      parts: [{ text: '1000 Lasagna Recipes...' }],
    },
  ],
  ttlSeconds: 60 * 5,
});

const { text: veggieLasangaRecipe } = await generateText({
  model: google(model),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
  providerOptions: {
    google: {
      cachedContent,
    },
  },
});

const { text: meatLasangaRecipe } = await generateText({
  model: google(model),
  prompt: 'Write a meat lasagna recipe for 12 people.',
  providerOptions: {
    google: {
      cachedContent,
    },
  },
});
```

### Code Execution

With [Code Execution](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/code-execution), certain models can generate and execute Python code to perform calculations, solve problems, or provide more accurate information.

You can enable code execution by adding the `code_execution` tool to your request.

```ts
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { googleTools } from '@ai-sdk/google/internal';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, toolCalls, toolResults } = await generateText({
  model: google('gemini-2.5-pro'),
  tools: { code_execution: google.tools.codeExecution({}) },
  prompt: 'Use python to calculate the 20th fibonacci number.',
});
```

The response will contain the tool calls and results from the code execution.

### Google Search

With [search grounding](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/google-search),
the model has access to the latest information using Google search.
Google search can be used to provide answers around current events:

```ts highlight="8,17-20"
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { GoogleGenerativeAIProviderMetadata } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, sources, providerMetadata } = await generateText({
  model: google('gemini-2.5-flash'),
  tools: {
    google_search: google.tools.googleSearch({}),
  },
  prompt:
    'List the top 5 San Francisco news from the past week.' +
    'You must include the date of each article.',
});

// access the grounding metadata. Casting to the provider metadata type
// is optional but provides autocomplete and type safety.
const metadata = providerMetadata?.google as
  | GoogleGenerativeAIProviderMetadata
  | undefined;
const groundingMetadata = metadata?.groundingMetadata;
const safetyRatings = metadata?.safetyRatings;
```

When Search Grounding is enabled, the model will include sources in the response.

Additionally, the grounding metadata includes detailed information about how search results were used to ground the model's response. Here are the available fields:

- **`webSearchQueries`** (`string[] | null`)

  - Array of search queries used to retrieve information
  - Example: `["What's the weather in Chicago this weekend?"]`

- **`searchEntryPoint`** (`{ renderedContent: string } | null`)

  - Contains the main search result content used as an entry point
  - The `renderedContent` field contains the formatted content

- **`groundingSupports`** (Array of support objects | null)
  - Contains details about how specific response parts are supported by search results
  - Each support object includes:
    - **`segment`**: Information about the grounded text segment
      - `text`: The actual text segment
      - `startIndex`: Starting position in the response
      - `endIndex`: Ending position in the response
    - **`groundingChunkIndices`**: References to supporting search result chunks
    - **`confidenceScores`**: Confidence scores (0-1) for each supporting chunk

Example response:

```json
{
  "groundingMetadata": {
    "webSearchQueries": ["What's the weather in Chicago this weekend?"],
    "searchEntryPoint": {
      "renderedContent": "..."
    },
    "groundingSupports": [
      {
        "segment": {
          "startIndex": 0,
          "endIndex": 65,
          "text": "Chicago weather changes rapidly, so layers let you adjust easily."
        },
        "groundingChunkIndices": [0],
        "confidenceScores": [0.99]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### File Search

The [File Search tool](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/file-search) lets Gemini retrieve context from your own documents that you have indexed in File Search stores. Only Gemini 2.5 models support this feature.

```ts highlight="9-13"
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, sources } = await generateText({
  model: google('gemini-2.5-pro'),
  tools: {
    file_search: google.tools.fileSearch({
      fileSearchStoreNames: [
        'projects/my-project/locations/us/fileSearchStores/my-store',
      ],
      metadataFilter: 'author = "Robert Graves"',
      topK: 8,
    }),
  },
  prompt: "Summarise the key themes of 'I, Claudius'.",
});
```

File Search responses include citations via the normal `sources` field and expose raw [grounding metadata](#google-search) in `providerMetadata.google.groundingMetadata`.

### URL Context

Google provides a provider-defined URL context tool.

The URL context tool allows the you to provide specific URLs that you want the model to analyze directly in from the prompt.

```ts highlight="9,13-17"
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, sources, providerMetadata } = await generateText({
  model: google('gemini-2.5-flash'),
  prompt: `Based on the document: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/url-context.
          Answer this question: How many links we can consume in one request?`,
  tools: {
    url_context: google.tools.urlContext({}),
  },
});

const metadata = providerMetadata?.google as
  | GoogleGenerativeAIProviderMetadata
  | undefined;
const groundingMetadata = metadata?.groundingMetadata;
const urlContextMetadata = metadata?.urlContextMetadata;
```

The URL context metadata includes detailed information about how the model used the URL context to generate the response. Here are the available fields:

- **`urlMetadata`** (`{ retrievedUrl: string; urlRetrievalStatus: string; }[] | null`)

  - Array of URL context metadata
  - Each object includes:
    - **`retrievedUrl`**: The URL of the context
    - **`urlRetrievalStatus`**: The status of the URL retrieval

Example response:

```json
{
  "urlMetadata": [
    {
      "retrievedUrl": "https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/google-generative-ai",
      "urlRetrievalStatus": "URL_RETRIEVAL_STATUS_SUCCESS"
    }
  ]
}
```

With the URL context tool, you will also get the `groundingMetadata`.

```json
"groundingMetadata": {
    "groundingChunks": [
        {
            "web": {
                "uri": "https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/google-generative-ai",
                "title": "Google Generative AI - AI SDK Providers"
            }
        }
    ],
    "groundingSupports": [
        {
            "segment": {
                "startIndex": 67,
                "endIndex": 157,
                "text": "**Installation**: Install the `@ai-sdk/google` module using your preferred package manager"
            },
            "groundingChunkIndices": [
                0
            ]
        },
    ]
}
```

<Note>You can add up to 20 URLs per request.</Note>

<Note>
  The URL context tool is only supported for Gemini 2.0 Flash models and above.
  Check the [supported models for URL context
  tool](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/url-context#supported-models).
</Note>

#### Combine URL Context with Search Grounding

You can combine the URL context tool with search grounding to provide the model with the latest information from the web.

```ts highlight="9-10"
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, sources, providerMetadata } = await generateText({
  model: google('gemini-2.5-flash'),
  prompt: `Based on this context: https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/google-generative-ai, tell me how to use Gemini with AI SDK.
    Also, provide the latest news about AI SDK V5.`,
  tools: {
    google_search: google.tools.googleSearch({}),
    url_context: google.tools.urlContext({}),
  },
});

const metadata = providerMetadata?.google as
  | GoogleGenerativeAIProviderMetadata
  | undefined;
const groundingMetadata = metadata?.groundingMetadata;
const urlContextMetadata = metadata?.urlContextMetadata;
```

### RAG Engine Grounding

With [RAG Engine Grounding](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/rag-engine/use-vertexai-search#generate-content-using-gemini-api),
the model has access to your custom knowledge base using the Vertex RAG Engine.
This enables the model to provide answers based on your specific data sources and documents.

<Note>
  RAG Engine Grounding is only supported with Vertex Gemini models. You must use
  the Google Vertex provider (`@ai-sdk/google-vertex`) instead of the standard
  Google provider (`@ai-sdk/google`) to use this feature.
</Note>

```ts highlight="8,17-20"
import { createVertex } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex';
import { GoogleGenerativeAIProviderMetadata } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const vertex = createVertex({
  project: 'my-project',
  location: 'us-central1',
});

const { text, sources, providerMetadata } = await generateText({
  model: vertex('gemini-2.5-flash'),
  tools: {
    vertex_rag_store: vertex.tools.vertexRagStore({
      ragCorpus:
        'projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/ragCorpora/my-rag-corpus',
      topK: 5,
    }),
  },
  prompt:
    'What are the key features of our product according to our documentation?',
});

// access the grounding metadata. Casting to the provider metadata type
// is optional but provides autocomplete and type safety.
const metadata = providerMetadata?.google as
  | GoogleGenerativeAIProviderMetadata
  | undefined;
const groundingMetadata = metadata?.groundingMetadata;
const safetyRatings = metadata?.safetyRatings;
```

When RAG Engine Grounding is enabled, the model will include sources from your RAG corpus in the response.

Additionally, the grounding metadata includes detailed information about how RAG results were used to ground the model's response. Here are the available fields:

- **`groundingChunks`** (Array of chunk objects | null)

import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: google('gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview'),
  prompt:
    'Create a picture of a nano banana dish in a fancy restaurant with a Gemini theme',
});

for (const file of result.files) {
  if (file.mediaType.startsWith('image/')) {
    console.log('Generated image:', file);
  }
}
```

### Safety Ratings

The safety ratings provide insight into the safety of the model's response.
See [Google AI documentation on safety settings](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/safety-settings).

Example response excerpt:

```json

      "severityScore": 0.09089675
    }
  ]
}
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Schema Limitations

The Google Generative AI API uses a subset of the OpenAPI 3.0 schema,
which does not support features such as unions.
The errors that you get in this case look like this:

`GenerateContentRequest.generation_config.response_schema.properties[occupation].type: must be specified`

By default, structured outputs are enabled (and for tool calling they are required).
You can disable structured outputs for object generation as a workaround:

```ts highlight="3,8"
const { object } = await generateObject({
  model: google('gemini-2.5-flash'),
  providerOptions: {
    google: {
      structuredOutputs: false,
    },
  },
  schema: z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    age: z.number(),
    contact: z.union([
      z.object({
        type: z.literal('email'),
        value: z.string(),
      }),
      z.object({
        type: z.literal('phone'),
        value: z.string(),
      }),
    ]),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate an example person for testing.',
});
```

The following Zod features are known to not work with Google Generative AI:

- `z.union`
- `z.record`

<Note>
  The table above lists popular models. Please see the [Google Generative AI
  docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/) for a full list of
  available models. The table above lists popular models. You can also pass any
  available provider model ID as a string if needed.
</Note>

## Gemma Models

You can use [Gemma models](https://deepmind.google/models/gemma/) with the Google Generative AI API.

Gemma models don't natively support the `systemInstruction` parameter, but the provider automatically handles system instructions by prepending them to the first user message. This allows you to use system instructions with Gemma models seamlessly:

```ts
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: google('gemma-3-27b-it'),
  system: 'You are a helpful assistant that responds concisely.',
  prompt: 'What is machine learning?',
});
```

The system instruction is automatically formatted and included in the conversation, so Gemma models can follow the guidance without any additional configuration.

## Embedding Models

You can create models that call the [Google Generative AI embeddings API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/embeddings)
using the `.textEmbedding()` factory method.

```ts
const model = google.textEmbedding('gemini-embedding-001');
```

The Google Generative AI provider sends API calls to the right endpoint based on the type of embedding:

- **Single embeddings**: When embedding a single value with `embed()`, the provider uses the single `:embedContent` endpoint, which typically has higher rate limits compared to the batch endpoint.
- **Batch embeddings**: When embedding multiple values with `embedMany()` or multiple values in `embed()`, the provider uses the `:batchEmbedContents` endpoint.

Google Generative AI embedding models support aditional settings. You can pass them as an options argument:

```ts
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { embed } from 'ai';

const model = google.textEmbedding('gemini-embedding-001');

const { embedding } = await embed({
  model,
  value: 'sunny day at the beach',
  providerOptions: {
    google: {
      outputDimensionality: 512, // optional, number of dimensions for the embedding
      taskType: 'SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY', // optional, specifies the task type for generating embeddings
    },
  },
});
```

The following optional provider options are available for Google Generative AI embedding models:

- **outputDimensionality**: _number_

  Optional reduced dimension for the output embedding. If set, excessive values in the output embedding are truncated from the end.

- **taskType**: _string_

  Optional. Specifies the task type for generating embeddings. Supported task types include:

  - `SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY`: Optimized for text similarity.
  - `CLASSIFICATION`: Optimized for text classification.
  - `CLUSTERING`: Optimized for clustering texts based on similarity.
  - `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT`: Optimized for document retrieval.
  - `RETRIEVAL_QUERY`: Optimized for query-based retrieval.
  - `QUESTION_ANSWERING`: Optimized for answering questions.
  - `FACT_VERIFICATION`: Optimized for verifying factual information.
  - `CODE_RETRIEVAL_QUERY`: Optimized for retrieving code blocks based on natural language queries.

### Model Capabilities

| Model                  | Default Dimensions | Custom Dimensions   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| `gemini-embedding-001` | 3072               | <Check size={18} /> |
| `text-embedding-004`   | 768                | <Check size={18} /> |

## Image Models

You can create [Imagen](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/imagen) models that call the Google Generative AI API using the `.image()` factory method.
For more on image generation with the AI SDK see [generateImage()](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-image).

```ts
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';

const { image } = await generateImage({
  model: google.image('imagen-3.0-generate-002'),
  prompt: 'A futuristic cityscape at sunset',
  aspectRatio: '16:9',
});
```

Further configuration can be done using Google provider options. You can validate the provider options using the `GoogleGenerativeAIImageProviderOptions` type.

```ts
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { GoogleGenerativeAIImageProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';

const { image } = await generateImage({
  model: google.image('imagen-3.0-generate-002'),
  providerOptions: {
    google: {
      personGeneration: 'dont_allow',
    } satisfies GoogleGenerativeAIImageProviderOptions,
  },
  // ...
});
```

The following provider options are available:

- **personGeneration** `allow_adult` | `allow_all` | `dont_allow`
  Whether to allow person generation. Defaults to `allow_adult`.

<Note>
  Imagen models do not support the `size` parameter. Use the `aspectRatio`
  parameter instead.
</Note>

#### Model Capabilities

| Model                     | Aspect Ratios             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `imagen-3.0-generate-002` | 1:1, 3:4, 4:3, 9:16, 16:9 |

# Google Vertex Provider

The Google Vertex provider for the [AI SDK](/docs) contains language model support for the [Google Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) APIs. This includes support for [Google's Gemini models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/models) and [Anthropic's Claude partner models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/use-claude).

<Note>
  The Google Vertex provider is compatible with both Node.js and Edge runtimes.
  The Edge runtime is supported through the `@ai-sdk/google-vertex/edge`
  sub-module. More details can be found in the [Google Vertex Edge
  Runtime](#google-vertex-edge-runtime) and [Google Vertex Anthropic Edge
  Runtime](#google-vertex-anthropic-edge-runtime) sections below.
</Note>

## Setup

The Google Vertex and Google Vertex Anthropic providers are both available in the `@ai-sdk/google-vertex` module. You can install it with

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/google-vertex" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/google-vertex" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet
      text="yarn add @ai-sdk/google-vertex @google-cloud/vertexai"
      dark
    />
</Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="bun add @ai-sdk/google-vertex" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Google Vertex Provider Usage

The Google Vertex provider instance is used to create model instances that call the Vertex AI API. The models available with this provider include [Google's Gemini models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/models). If you're looking to use [Anthropic's Claude models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/use-claude), see the [Google Vertex Anthropic Provider](#google-vertex-anthropic-provider-usage) section below.

### Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `vertex` from `@ai-sdk/google-vertex`:

```ts
import { vertex } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createVertex` from `@ai-sdk/google-vertex` and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createVertex } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex';

const vertex = createVertex({
  project: 'my-project', // optional
  location: 'us-central1', // optional
});
```

Google Vertex supports two different authentication implementations depending on your runtime environment.

#### Node.js Runtime

The Node.js runtime is the default runtime supported by the AI SDK. It supports all standard Google Cloud authentication options through the [`google-auth-library`](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-nodejs?tab=readme-ov-file#ways-to-authenticate). Typical use involves setting a path to a json credentials file in the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. The credentials file can be obtained from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).

If you want to customize the Google authentication options you can pass them as options to the `createVertex` function, for example:

```ts
import { createVertex } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex';

const vertex = createVertex({
  googleAuthOptions: {
    credentials: {
      client_email: 'my-email',
      private_key: 'my-private-key',
    },
  },
});
```

##### Optional Provider Settings

You can use the following optional settings to customize the provider instance:

- **project** _string_

  The Google Cloud project ID that you want to use for the API calls.
  It uses the `GOOGLE_VERTEX_PROJECT` environment variable by default.

- **location** _string_

  The Google Cloud location that you want to use for the API calls, e.g. `us-central1`.
  It uses the `GOOGLE_VERTEX_LOCATION` environment variable by default.

- **googleAuthOptions** _object_

  Optional. The Authentication options used by the [Google Auth Library](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-nodejs/). See also the [GoogleAuthOptions](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-nodejs/blob/08978822e1b7b5961f0e355df51d738e012be392/src/auth/googleauth.ts#L87C18-L87C35) interface.

  - **authClient** _object_
    An `AuthClient` to use.

  - **keyFilename** _string_
    Path to a .json, .pem, or .p12 key file.

  - **keyFile** _string_
    Path to a .json, .pem, or .p12 key file.

  - **credentials** _object_
    Object containing client_email and private_key properties, or the external account client options.

  - **clientOptions** _object_
    Options object passed to the constructor of the client.

  - **scopes** _string | string[]_
    Required scopes for the desired API request.

  - **projectId** _string_
    Your project ID.

  - **universeDomain** _string_
    The default service domain for a given Cloud universe.

- **headers** _Resolvable&lt;Record&lt;string, string | undefined&gt;&gt;_

  Headers to include in the requests. Can be provided in multiple formats:

  - A record of header key-value pairs: `Record<string, string | undefined>`
  - A function that returns headers: `() => Record<string, string | undefined>`
  - An async function that returns headers: `async () => Record<string, string | undefined>`
  - A promise that resolves to headers: `Promise<Record<string, string | undefined>>`

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  Defaults to the global `fetch` function.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

- **baseURL** _string_

  Optional. Base URL for the Google Vertex API calls e.g. to use proxy servers. By default, it is constructed using the location and project:
  `https://${location}-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${project}/locations/${location}/publishers/google`

<a id="google-vertex-edge-runtime"></a>

#### Edge Runtime

Edge runtimes (like Vercel Edge Functions and Cloudflare Workers) are lightweight JavaScript environments that run closer to users at the network edge.
They only provide a subset of the standard Node.js APIs.
For example, direct file system access is not available, and many Node.js-specific libraries
(including the standard Google Auth library) are not compatible.

The Edge runtime version of the Google Vertex provider supports Google's [Application Default Credentials](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-nodejs?tab=readme-ov-file#application-default-credentials) through environment variables. The values can be obtained from a json credentials file from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).

You can import the default provider instance `vertex` from `@ai-sdk/google-vertex/edge`:

```ts
import { vertex } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex/edge';
```

<Note>
  The `/edge` sub-module is included in the `@ai-sdk/google-vertex` package, so
  you don't need to install it separately. You must import from
  `@ai-sdk/google-vertex/edge` to differentiate it from the Node.js provider.
</Note>

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createVertex` from `@ai-sdk/google-vertex/edge` and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createVertex } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex/edge';

const vertex = createVertex({
  project: 'my-project', // optional
  location: 'us-central1', // optional
});
```

For Edge runtime authentication, you'll need to set these environment variables from your Google Default Application Credentials JSON file:

- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
- `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID` (optional)

These values can be obtained from a service account JSON file from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).

##### Optional Provider Settings

You can use the following optional settings to customize the provider instance:

- **project** _string_

  The Google Cloud project ID that you want to use for the API calls.
  It uses the `GOOGLE_VERTEX_PROJECT` environment variable by default.

- **location** _string_

  The Google Cloud location that you want to use for the API calls, e.g. `us-central1`.
  It uses the `GOOGLE_VERTEX_LOCATION` environment variable by default.

- **googleCredentials** _object_

  Optional. The credentials used by the Edge provider for authentication. These credentials are typically set through environment variables and are derived from a service account JSON file.

  - **clientEmail** _string_
    The client email from the service account JSON file. Defaults to the contents of the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL` environment variable.

  - **privateKey** _string_
    The private key from the service account JSON file. Defaults to the contents of the `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable.

  - **privateKeyId** _string_
    The private key ID from the service account JSON file (optional). Defaults to the contents of the `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID` environment variable.

- **headers** _Resolvable&lt;Record&lt;string, string | undefined&gt;&gt;_

  Headers to include in the requests. Can be provided in multiple formats:

  - A record of header key-value pairs: `Record<string, string | undefined>`
  - A function that returns headers: `() => Record<string, string | undefined>`
  - An async function that returns headers: `async () => Record<string, string | undefined>`
  - A promise that resolves to headers: `Promise<Record<string, string | undefined>>`

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  Defaults to the global `fetch` function.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

### Language Models

You can create models that call the Vertex API using the provider instance.
The first argument is the model id, e.g. `gemini-1.5-pro`.

```ts
const model = vertex('gemini-1.5-pro');
```

<Note>
  If you are using [your own
  models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training-overview), the name
  of your model needs to start with `projects/`.
</Note>

Google Vertex models support also some model specific settings that are not part
of the [standard call settings](/docs/ai-sdk-core/settings). You can pass them as
an options argument:

```ts
const model = vertex('gemini-1.5-pro');

await generateText({
  model,
  providerOptions: {
    google: {
      safetySettings: [
        {
          category: 'HARM_CATEGORY_UNSPECIFIED',
          threshold: 'BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE',
        },
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

The following optional provider options are available for Google Vertex models:

- **structuredOutputs** _boolean_

  Optional. Enable structured output. Default is true.

  This is useful when the JSON Schema contains elements that are
  not supported by the OpenAPI schema version that
  Google Vertex uses. You can use this to disable
  structured outputs if you need to.

  See [Troubleshooting: Schema Limitations](#schema-limitations) for more details.

- **safetySettings** _Array\<\{ category: string; threshold: string \}\>_

  Optional. Safety settings for the model.

  - **category** _string_

    The category of the safety setting. Can be one of the following:

    - `HARM_CATEGORY_UNSPECIFIED`
    - `HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH`
    - `HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT`
    - `HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT`
    - `HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT`
    - `HARM_CATEGORY_CIVIC_INTEGRITY`

  - **threshold** _string_

    The threshold of the safety setting. Can be one of the following:

    - `HARM_BLOCK_THRESHOLD_UNSPECIFIED`
    - `BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE`
    - `BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE`
    - `BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH`
    - `BLOCK_NONE`

- **audioTimestamp** _boolean_

  Optional. Enables timestamp understanding for audio files. Defaults to false.

  This is useful for generating transcripts with accurate timestamps.
  Consult [Google's Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/audio-understanding) for usage details.

- **labels** _object_

  Optional. Defines labels used in billing reports.

  Consult [Google's Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/add-labels-to-api-calls) for usage details.

You can use Google Vertex language models to generate text with the `generateText` function:

```ts highlight="1,4"
import { vertex } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: vertex('gemini-1.5-pro'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

Google Vertex language models can also be used in the `streamText` function
(see [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core)).

#### Code Execution

With [Code Execution](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/code-execution), certain Gemini models on Vertex AI can generate and execute Python code. This allows the model to perform calculations, data manipulation, and other programmatic tasks to enhance its responses.

You can enable code execution by adding the `code_execution` tool to your request.

```ts
import { vertex } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: vertex('gemini-2.5-pro'),
  tools: { code_execution: vertex.tools.codeExecution({}) },
  prompt:
    'Use python to calculate 20th fibonacci number. Then find the nearest palindrome to it.',
});
```

The response will contain `tool-call` and `tool-result` parts for the executed code.

#### URL Context

URL Context allows Gemini models to retrieve and analyze content from URLs. Supported models: Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, 2.5 Pro, 2.5 Flash, 2.0 Flash.

```ts
import { vertex } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: vertex('gemini-2.5-pro'),
  tools: { url_context: vertex.tools.urlContext({}) },
  prompt: 'What are the key points from https://example.com/article?',
});
```

#### Google Search

Google Search enables Gemini models to access real-time web information. Supported models: Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, 2.5 Flash, 2.0 Flash, 2.5 Pro.

```ts
import { vertex } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: vertex('gemini-2.5-pro'),
  tools: { google_search: vertex.tools.googleSearch({}) },
  prompt: 'What are the latest developments in AI?',
});
```

#### Reasoning (Thinking Tokens)

Google Vertex AI, through its support for Gemini models, can also emit "thinking" tokens, representing the model's reasoning process. The AI SDK exposes these as reasoning information.

To enable thinking tokens for compatible Gemini models via Vertex, set `includeThoughts: true` in the `thinkingConfig` provider option. Since the Vertex provider uses the Google provider's underlying language model, these options are passed through `providerOptions.google`:

```ts
import { vertex } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex';
import { GoogleGenerativeAIProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/google'; // Note: importing from @ai-sdk/google
import { generateText, streamText } from 'ai';

// For generateText:
const { text, reasoning, reasoningDetails } = await generateText({
  model: vertex('gemini-2.0-flash-001'), // Or other supported model via Vertex
  providerOptions: {
    google: {
      // Options are nested under 'google' for Vertex provider
      thinkingConfig: {
        includeThoughts: true,
        // thinkingBudget: 2048, // Optional
      },
    } satisfies GoogleGenerativeAIProviderOptions,
  },
  prompt: 'Explain quantum computing in simple terms.',
});

console.log('Reasoning:', reasoning);
console.log('Reasoning Details:', reasoningDetails);
console.log('Final Text:', text);

// For streamText:
const result = streamText({
  model: vertex('gemini-2.0-flash-001'), // Or other supported model via Vertex
  providerOptions: {
    google: {
      // Options are nested under 'google' for Vertex provider
      thinkingConfig: {
        includeThoughts: true,
        // thinkingBudget: 2048, // Optional
      },
    } satisfies GoogleGenerativeAIProviderOptions,
  },
  prompt: 'Explain quantum computing in simple terms.',
});

for await (const part of result.fullStream) {
  if (part.type === 'reasoning') {
    process.stdout.write(`THOUGHT: ${part.textDelta}\n`);
  } else if (part.type === 'text-delta') {
    process.stdout.write(part.textDelta);
  }
}
```

When `includeThoughts` is true, parts of the API response marked with `thought: true` will be processed as reasoning.

- In `generateText`, these contribute to the `reasoning` (string) and `reasoningDetails` (array) fields.
- In `streamText`, these are emitted as `reasoning` stream parts.

<Note>
  Refer to the [Google Vertex AI documentation on
  "thinking"](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/thinking)
  for model compatibility and further details.
</Note>

#### File Inputs

The Google Vertex provider supports file inputs, e.g. PDF files.

```ts
import { vertex } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: vertex('gemini-1.5-pro'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: 'What is an embedding model according to this document?',
        },
        {
          type: 'file',
          data: fs.readFileSync('./data/ai.pdf'),
          mediaType: 'application/pdf',
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

<Note>
  The AI SDK will automatically download URLs if you pass them as data, except
  for `gs://` URLs. You can use the Google Cloud Storage API to upload larger
  files to that location.
</Note>

See [File Parts](/docs/foundations/prompts#file-parts) for details on how to use files in prompts.

### Safety Ratings

The safety ratings provide insight into the safety of the model's response.
See [Google Vertex AI documentation on configuring safety filters](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/configure-safety-filters).

Example response excerpt:

```json
{
  "safetyRatings": [
    {
      "category": "HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH",
      "probability": "NEGLIGIBLE",
      "probabilityScore": 0.11027937,
      "severity": "HARM_SEVERITY_LOW",
      "severityScore": 0.28487435
    },
    {
      "category": "HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT",
      "probability": "HIGH",
      "blocked": true,
      "probabilityScore": 0.95422274,
      "severity": "HARM_SEVERITY_MEDIUM",
      "severityScore": 0.43398145
    },
    {
      "category": "HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT",
      "probability": "NEGLIGIBLE",
      "probabilityScore": 0.11085559,
      "severity": "HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE",
      "severityScore": 0.19027223
    },
    {
      "category": "HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT",
      "probability": "NEGLIGIBLE",
      "probabilityScore": 0.22901751,
      "severity": "HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE",
      "severityScore": 0.09089675
    }
  ]
}
```

For more details, see the [Google Vertex AI documentation on grounding with Google Search](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/ground-gemini#ground-to-search).

### Troubleshooting

#### Schema Limitations

The Google Vertex API uses a subset of the OpenAPI 3.0 schema,
which does not support features such as unions.
The errors that you get in this case look like this:

`GenerateContentRequest.generation_config.response_schema.properties[occupation].type: must be specified`

By default, structured outputs are enabled (and for tool calling they are required).
You can disable structured outputs for object generation as a workaround:

```ts highlight="3,8"
const result = await generateObject({
  model: vertex('gemini-1.5-pro'),
  providerOptions: {
    google: {
      structuredOutputs: false,
    },
  },
  schema: z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    age: z.number(),
    contact: z.union([
      z.object({
        type: z.literal('email'),
        value: z.string(),
      }),
      z.object({
        type: z.literal('phone'),
        value: z.string(),
      }),
    ]),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate an example person for testing.',
});
```

The following Zod features are known to not work with Google Vertex:

- `z.union`
- `z.record`

<Note>
  The table above lists popular models. Please see the [Google Vertex AI
  docs](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference#supported-models)
  for a full list of available models. The table above lists popular models. You
  can also pass any available provider model ID as a string if needed.
</Note>

### Embedding Models

You can create models that call the Google Vertex AI embeddings API using the `.textEmbeddingModel()` factory method:

```ts
const model = vertex.textEmbeddingModel('text-embedding-004');
```

Google Vertex AI embedding models support additional settings. You can pass them as an options argument:

```ts
import { vertex } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex';
import { embed } from 'ai';

const model = vertex.textEmbeddingModel('text-embedding-004');

const { embedding } = await embed({
  model,
  value: 'sunny day at the beach',
  providerOptions: {
    google: {
      outputDimensionality: 512, // optional, number of dimensions for the embedding
      taskType: 'SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY', // optional, specifies the task type for generating embeddings
      autoTruncate: false, // optional
    },
  },
});
```

The following optional provider options are available for Google Vertex AI embedding models:

- **outputDimensionality**: _number_

  Optional reduced dimension for the output embedding. If set, excessive values in the output embedding are truncated from the end.

- **taskType**: _string_

  Optional. Specifies the task type for generating embeddings. Supported task types include:

  - `SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY`: Optimized for text similarity.
  - `CLASSIFICATION`: Optimized for text classification.
  - `CLUSTERING`: Optimized for clustering texts based on similarity.
  - `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT`: Optimized for document retrieval.
  - `RETRIEVAL_QUERY`: Optimized for query-based retrieval.
  - `QUESTION_ANSWERING`: Optimized for answering questions.
  - `FACT_VERIFICATION`: Optimized for verifying factual information.
  - `CODE_RETRIEVAL_QUERY`: Optimized for retrieving code blocks based on natural language queries.

- **title**: _string_

  Optional. The title of the document being embedded. This helps the model produce better embeddings by providing additional context. Only valid when `taskType` is set to `'RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT'`.

- **autoTruncate**: _boolean_

  Optional. When set to `true`, input text will be truncated if it exceeds the maximum length. When set to `false`, an error is returned if the input text is too long. Defaults to `true`.

#### Model Capabilities

| Model                | Max Values Per Call | Parallel Calls      |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| `text-embedding-004` | 2048                | <Check size={18} /> |

<Note>
  The table above lists popular models. You can also pass any available provider
  model ID as a string if needed.
</Note>

### Image Models

You can create [Imagen](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/image/overview) models that call the [Imagen on Vertex AI API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/image/generate-images)
using the `.image()` factory method. For more on image generation with the AI SDK see [generateImage()](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-image).

```ts
import { vertex } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex';
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';

const { image } = await generateImage({
  model: vertex.image('imagen-3.0-generate-002'),
  prompt: 'A futuristic cityscape at sunset',
  aspectRatio: '16:9',
});
```

Further configuration can be done using Google Vertex provider options. You can validate the provider options using the `GoogleVertexImageProviderOptions` type.

```ts
import { vertex } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex';
import { GoogleVertexImageProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex';
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';

const { image } = await generateImage({
  model: vertex.image('imagen-3.0-generate-002'),
  providerOptions: {
    vertex: {
      negativePrompt: 'pixelated, blurry, low-quality',
    } satisfies GoogleVertexImageProviderOptions,
  },
  // ...
});
```

The following provider options are available:

- **negativePrompt** _string_
  A description of what to discourage in the generated images.

- **personGeneration** `allow_adult` | `allow_all` | `dont_allow`
  Whether to allow person generation. Defaults to `allow_adult`.

- **safetySetting** `block_low_and_above` | `block_medium_and_above` | `block_only_high` | `block_none`
  Whether to block unsafe content. Defaults to `block_medium_and_above`.

- **addWatermark** _boolean_
  Whether to add an invisible watermark to the generated images. Defaults to `true`.

- **storageUri** _string_
  Cloud Storage URI to store the generated images.

<Note>
  Imagen models do not support the `size` parameter. Use the `aspectRatio`
  parameter instead.
</Note>

Additional information about the images can be retrieved using Google Vertex meta data.

```ts
import { vertex } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex';
import { GoogleVertexImageProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex';
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';

const { image, providerMetadata } = await generateImage({
  model: vertex.image('imagen-3.0-generate-002'),
  prompt: 'A futuristic cityscape at sunset',
  aspectRatio: '16:9',
});

console.log(
  `Revised prompt: ${providerMetadata.vertex.images[0].revisedPrompt}`
);
```

#### Model Capabilities

| Model                                     | Aspect Ratios             |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `imagen-3.0-generate-001`                 | 1:1, 3:4, 4:3, 9:16, 16:9 |
| `imagen-3.0-generate-002`                 | 1:1, 3:4, 4:3, 9:16, 16:9 |

| `imagen-4.0-ultra-generate-preview-06-06` | 1:1, 3:4, 4:3, 9:16, 16:9 |

## Google Vertex Anthropic Provider Usage

The Google Vertex Anthropic provider for the [AI SDK](/docs) offers support for Anthropic's Claude models through the Google Vertex AI APIs. This section provides details on how to set up and use the Google Vertex Anthropic provider.

### Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `vertexAnthropic` from `@ai-sdk/google-vertex/anthropic`:

```typescript
import { vertexAnthropic } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex/anthropic';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createVertexAnthropic` from `@ai-sdk/google-vertex/anthropic` and create a provider instance with your settings:

```typescript
import { createVertexAnthropic } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex/anthropic';

const vertexAnthropic = createVertexAnthropic({
  project: 'my-project', // optional
  location: 'us-central1', // optional
});
```

#### Node.js Runtime

For Node.js environments, the Google Vertex Anthropic provider supports all standard Google Cloud authentication options through the `google-auth-library`. You can customize the authentication options by passing them to the `createVertexAnthropic` function:

```typescript
import { createVertexAnthropic } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex/anthropic';

const vertexAnthropic = createVertexAnthropic({
  googleAuthOptions: {
    credentials: {
      client_email: 'my-email',
      private_key: 'my-private-key',
    },
  },
});
```

##### Optional Provider Settings

You can use the following optional settings to customize the Google Vertex Anthropic provider instance:

- **project** _string_

  The Google Cloud project ID that you want to use for the API calls.
  It uses the `GOOGLE_VERTEX_PROJECT` environment variable by default.

- **location** _string_

  The Google Cloud location that you want to use for the API calls, e.g. `us-central1`.
  It uses the `GOOGLE_VERTEX_LOCATION` environment variable by default.

- **googleAuthOptions** _object_

  Optional. The Authentication options used by the [Google Auth Library](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-nodejs/). See also the [GoogleAuthOptions](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-nodejs/blob/08978822e1b7b5961f0e355df51d738e012be392/src/auth/googleauth.ts#L87C18-L87C35) interface.

  - **authClient** _object_

  - **keyFile** _string_
    Path to a .json, .pem, or .p12 key file.

  - **credentials** _object_
    Object containing client_email and private_key properties, or the external account client options.

  - **clientOptions** _object_
    Options object passed to the constructor of the client.

  - **scopes** _string | string[]_
    Required scopes for the desired API request.

  - **projectId** _string_
    Your project ID.

  - **universeDomain** _string_
    The default service domain for a given Cloud universe.

- **headers** _Resolvable&lt;Record&lt;string, string | undefined&gt;&gt;_

  Headers to include in the requests. Can be provided in multiple formats:

  - A record of header key-value pairs: `Record<string, string | undefined>`
  - A function that returns headers: `() => Record<string, string | undefined>`
  - An async function that returns headers: `async () => Record<string, string | undefined>`
  - A promise that resolves to headers: `Promise<Record<string, string | undefined>>`

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  Defaults to the global `fetch` function.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

<a id="google-vertex-anthropic-edge-runtime"></a>

#### Edge Runtime

Edge runtimes (like Vercel Edge Functions and Cloudflare Workers) are lightweight JavaScript environments that run closer to users at the network edge.
They only provide a subset of the standard Node.js APIs.
For example, direct file system access is not available, and many Node.js-specific libraries
(including the standard Google Auth library) are not compatible.

The Edge runtime version of the Google Vertex Anthropic provider supports Google's [Application Default Credentials](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-nodejs?tab=readme-ov-file#application-default-credentials) through environment variables. The values can be obtained from a json credentials file from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).

For Edge runtimes, you can import the provider instance from `@ai-sdk/google-vertex/anthropic/edge`:

```typescript
import { vertexAnthropic } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex/anthropic/edge';
```

To customize the setup, use `createVertexAnthropic` from the same module:

```typescript
import { createVertexAnthropic } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex/anthropic/edge';

const vertexAnthropic = createVertexAnthropic({
  project: 'my-project', // optional
  location: 'us-central1', // optional
});
```

For Edge runtime authentication, set these environment variables from your Google Default Application Credentials JSON file:

- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
- `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID` (optional)

##### Optional Provider Settings

You can use the following optional settings to customize the provider instance:

- **project** _string_

  The Google Cloud project ID that you want to use for the API calls.
  It uses the `GOOGLE_VERTEX_PROJECT` environment variable by default.

- **location** _string_

  The Google Cloud location that you want to use for the API calls, e.g. `us-central1`.
  It uses the `GOOGLE_VERTEX_LOCATION` environment variable by default.

- **googleCredentials** _object_

  Optional. The credentials used by the Edge provider for authentication. These credentials are typically set through environment variables and are derived from a service account JSON file.

  - **clientEmail** _string_
    The client email from the service account JSON file. Defaults to the contents of the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL` environment variable.

  - **privateKey** _string_
    The private key from the service account JSON file. Defaults to the contents of the `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable.

  - **privateKeyId** _string_
    The private key ID from the service account JSON file (optional). Defaults to the contents of the `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID` environment variable.

- **headers** _Resolvable&lt;Record&lt;string, string | undefined&gt;&gt;_

  Headers to include in the requests. Can be provided in multiple formats:

  - A record of header key-value pairs: `Record<string, string | undefined>`
  - A function that returns headers: `() => Record<string, string | undefined>`
  - An async function that returns headers: `async () => Record<string, string | undefined>`
  - A promise that resolves to headers: `Promise<Record<string, string | undefined>>`

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  Defaults to the global `fetch` function.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

### Language Models

You can create models that call the [Anthropic Messages API](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/messages_post) using the provider instance.
The first argument is the model id, e.g. `claude-3-haiku-20240307`.
Some models have multi-modal capabilities.

```ts
const model = anthropic('claude-3-haiku-20240307');
```

You can use Anthropic language models to generate text with the `generateText` function:

```ts
import { vertexAnthropic } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex/anthropic';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: vertexAnthropic('claude-3-haiku-20240307'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

Anthropic language models can also be used in the `streamText`, `generateObject`, and `streamObject` functions
(see [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core)).

<Note>
  The Anthropic API returns streaming tool calls all at once after a delay. This
  causes the `streamObject` function to generate the object fully after a delay
  instead of streaming it incrementally.
</Note>

The following optional provider options are available for Anthropic models:

- `sendReasoning` _boolean_

  Optional. Include reasoning content in requests sent to the model. Defaults to `true`.

  If you are experiencing issues with the model handling requests involving
  reasoning content, you can set this to `false` to omit them from the request.

- `thinking` _object_

  Optional. See [Reasoning section](#reasoning) for more details.

### Reasoning

Anthropic has reasoning support for the `claude-3-7-sonnet@20250219` model.

You can enable it using the `thinking` provider option
and specifying a thinking budget in tokens.

```ts
import { vertexAnthropic } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex/anthropic';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, reasoning, reasoningDetails } = await generateText({
  model: vertexAnthropic('claude-3-7-sonnet@20250219'),
  prompt: 'How many people will live in the world in 2040?',
  providerOptions: {
    anthropic: {
      thinking: { type: 'enabled', budgetTokens: 12000 },
    },
  },
});

console.log(reasoning); // reasoning text
console.log(reasoningDetails); // reasoning details including redacted reasoning
console.log(text); // text response
```

See [AI SDK UI: Chatbot](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot#reasoning) for more details
on how to integrate reasoning into your chatbot.

#### Cache Control

<Note>
  Anthropic cache control is in a Pre-Generally Available (GA) state on Google
  Vertex. For more see [Google Vertex Anthropic cache control
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/claude-prompt-caching).
</Note>

In the messages and message parts, you can use the `providerOptions` property to set cache control breakpoints.
You need to set the `anthropic` property in the `providerOptions` object to `{ cacheControl: { type: 'ephemeral' } }` to set a cache control breakpoint.

The cache creation input tokens are then returned in the `providerMetadata` object
for `generateText` and `generateObject`, again under the `anthropic` property.
When you use `streamText` or `streamObject`, the response contains a promise
that resolves to the metadata. Alternatively you can receive it in the
`onFinish` callback.

```ts highlight="8,18-20,29-30"
import { vertexAnthropic } from '@ai-sdk/google-vertex/anthropic';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const errorMessage = '... long error message ...';

const result = await generateText({
  model: vertexAnthropic('claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        { type: 'text', text: 'You are a JavaScript expert.' },
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: `Error message: ${errorMessage}`,
          providerOptions: {
            anthropic: { cacheControl: { type: 'ephemeral' } },
          },
        },
        { type: 'text', text: 'Explain the error message.' },
      ],
    },
  ],
});

console.log(result.text);
console.log(result.providerMetadata?.anthropic);
// e.g. { cacheCreationInputTokens: 2118, cacheReadInputTokens: 0 }
```

You can also use cache control on system messages by providing multiple system messages at the head of your messages array:

```ts highlight="3,9-11"
const result = await generateText({
  model: vertexAnthropic('claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'system',
      content: 'Cached system message part',
      providerOptions: {
        anthropic: { cacheControl: { type: 'ephemeral' } },
      },
    },
    {
      role: 'system',
      content: 'Uncached system message part',
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: 'User prompt',
    },
  ],
});
```

For more on prompt caching with Anthropic, see [Google Vertex AI's Claude prompt caching documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/claude-prompt-caching) and [Anthropic's Cache Control documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching).

    command,
    path,
    file_text,
    insert_line,
    new_str,
    old_str,
    view_range,
  }) => {
    // Implement your text editing logic here
    // Return the result of the text editing operation
  },
});
```

Parameters:

- `command` ('view' | 'create' | 'str_replace' | 'insert' | 'undo_edit'): The command to run.

- `old_str` (string, optional): Required for `str_replace` command, containing the string to replace.
- `view_range` (number[], optional): Optional for `view` command to specify line range to show.

#### Computer Tool

The Computer Tool enables control of keyboard and mouse actions on a computer:

```ts
const computerTool = vertexAnthropic.tools.computer_20241022({
  displayWidthPx: 1920,
  displayHeightPx: 1080,
  displayNumber: 0, // Optional, for X11 environments

  execute: async ({ action, coordinate, text }) => {
    // Implement your computer control logic here
    // Return the result of the action

    // Example code:
    switch (action) {
      case 'screenshot': {
        // multipart result:
        return {
          type: 'image',
          data: fs
            .readFileSync('./data/screenshot-editor.png')
            .toString('base64'),
        };
      }
      default: {
        console.log('Action:', action);
        console.log('Coordinate:', coordinate);
        console.log('Text:', text);
        return `executed ${action}`;
      }
    }
  },

  // map to tool result content for LLM consumption:
  toModelOutput(result) {
    return typeof result === 'string'
      ? [{ type: 'text', text: result }]
      : [{ type: 'image', data: result.data, mediaType: 'image/png' }];
  },
});
```

Parameters:

- `action` ('key' | 'type' | 'mouse_move' | 'left_click' | 'left_click_drag' | 'right_click' | 'middle_click' | 'double_click' | 'screenshot' | 'cursor_position'): The action to perform.
- `coordinate` (number[], optional): Required for `mouse_move` and `left_click_drag` actions. Specifies the (x, y) coordinates.
- `text` (string, optional): Required for `type` and `key` actions.

These tools can be used in conjunction with the `claude-3-5-sonnet-v2@20241022` model to enable more complex interactions and tasks.

# Rev.ai Provider

The [Rev.ai](https://www.rev.ai/) provider contains language model support for the Rev.ai transcription API.

## Setup

The Rev.ai provider is available in the `@ai-sdk/revai` module. You can install it with

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/revai" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/revai" dark />

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `revai` from `@ai-sdk/revai`:

```ts
import { revai } from '@ai-sdk/revai';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createRevai` from `@ai-sdk/revai` and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createRevai } from '@ai-sdk/revai';

const revai = createRevai({
  // custom settings, e.g.
  fetch: customFetch,
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the Rev.ai provider instance:

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header.
  It defaults to the `REVAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

# Baseten Provider

[Baseten](https://baseten.co/) is an inference platform for serving frontier, enterprise-grade opensource AI models via their [API](https://docs.baseten.co/overview).

## Setup

The Baseten provider is available via the `@ai-sdk/baseten` module. You can install it with

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/baseten" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/baseten" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/baseten" dark />
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `baseten` from `@ai-sdk/baseten`:

```ts
import { baseten } from '@ai-sdk/baseten';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createBaseten` from `@ai-sdk/baseten`
and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createBaseten } from '@ai-sdk/baseten';

const baseten = createBaseten({
  apiKey: process.env.BASETEN_API_KEY ?? '',
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the Baseten provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls, e.g. to use proxy servers.
  The default prefix is `https://inference.baseten.co/v1`.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header. It defaults to
  the `BASETEN_API_KEY` environment variable. It is recommended you set the environment variable using `export` so you do not need to include the field everytime.
  You can grab your Baseten API Key [here](https://app.baseten.co/settings/api_keys)

- **modelURL** _string_

  Custom model URL for specific models (chat or embeddings). If not provided,
  the default Model APIs will be used.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.

## Model APIs

You can select [Baseten models](https://www.baseten.co/products/model-apis/) using a provider instance.
The first argument is the model id, e.g. `'moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905'`: The complete supported models under Model APIs can be found [here](https://docs.baseten.co/development/model-apis/overview#supported-models).

```ts
const model = baseten('moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905');
```

### Example

You can use Baseten language models to generate text with the `generateText` function:

```ts
import { baseten } from '@ai-sdk/baseten';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: baseten('moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905'),
  prompt: 'What is the meaning of life? Answer in one sentence.',
});
```

Baseten language models can also be used in the `streamText` function
(see [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core)).

## Dedicated Models

Baseten supports dedicated model URLs for both chat and embedding models. You have to specify a `modelURL` when creating the provider:

### OpenAI-Compatible Endpoints (`/sync/v1`)

For models deployed with Baseten's OpenAI-compatible endpoints:

```ts
import { createBaseten } from '@ai-sdk/baseten';

const baseten = createBaseten({
  modelURL: 'https://model-{MODEL_ID}.api.baseten.co/sync/v1',
});
// No modelId is needed because we specified modelURL
const model = baseten();
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: model,
  prompt: 'Say hello from a Baseten chat model!',
});
```

### `/predict` Endpoints

`/predict` endpoints are currently NOT supported for chat models. You must use `/sync/v1` endpoints for chat functionality.

## Embedding Models

You can create models that call the Baseten embeddings API using the `.textEmbeddingModel()` factory method. The Baseten provider uses the high-performance `@basetenlabs/performance-client` for optimal embedding performance.

<Note>
  **Important:** Embedding models require a dedicated deployment with a custom
  `modelURL`. Unlike chat models, embeddings cannot use Baseten's default Model
  APIs and must specify a dedicated model endpoint.
</Note>

```ts
import { createBaseten } from '@ai-sdk/baseten';
import { embed, embedMany } from 'ai';

const baseten = createBaseten({
  modelURL: 'https://model-{MODEL_ID}.api.baseten.co/sync',
});

const embeddingModel = baseten.textEmbeddingModel();

// Single embedding
const { embedding } = await embed({
  model: embeddingModel,
  value: 'sunny day at the beach',
});

// Batch embeddings
const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
  model: embeddingModel,
  values: [
    'sunny day at the beach',
    'rainy afternoon in the city',
    'snowy mountain peak',
  ],
});
```

### Endpoint Support for Embeddings

**Supported:**

- `/sync` endpoints (Performance Client automatically adds `/v1/embeddings`)
- `/sync/v1` endpoints (automatically strips `/v1` before passing to Performance Client)

**Not Supported:**

- `/predict` endpoints (not compatible with Performance Client)

### Performance Features

The embedding implementation includes:

- **High-performance client**: Uses `@basetenlabs/performance-client` for optimal performance
- **Automatic batching**: Efficiently handles multiple texts in a single request
- **Connection reuse**: Performance Client is created once and reused for all requests
- **Built-in retries**: Automatic retry logic for failed requests

## Error Handling

The Baseten provider includes built-in error handling for common API errors:

```ts
import { baseten } from '@ai-sdk/baseten';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

try {
  const { text } = await generateText({
    model: baseten('moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905'),
    prompt: 'Hello, world!',
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Baseten API error:', error.message);
}
```

### Common Error Scenarios

```ts
// Embeddings require a modelURL
try {
  baseten.textEmbeddingModel();
} catch (error) {
  // Error: "No model URL provided for embeddings. Please set modelURL option for embeddings."
}

// /predict endpoints are not supported for chat models
try {
  const baseten = createBaseten({
    modelURL:
      'https://model-{MODEL_ID}.api.baseten.co/environments/production/predict',
  });
  baseten(); // This will throw an error
} catch (error) {
  // Error: "Not supported. You must use a /sync/v1 endpoint for chat models."
}

// /sync/v1 endpoints are now supported for embeddings
const baseten = createBaseten({
  modelURL:
    'https://model-{MODEL_ID}.api.baseten.co/environments/production/sync/v1',
});
const embeddingModel = baseten.textEmbeddingModel(); // This works fine!

// /predict endpoints are not supported for embeddings
try {
  const baseten = createBaseten({
    modelURL:
      'https://model-{MODEL_ID}.api.baseten.co/environments/production/predict',
  });
  baseten.textEmbeddingModel(); // This will throw an error
} catch (error) {
  // Error: "Not supported. You must use a /sync or /sync/v1 endpoint for embeddings."
}

// Image models are not supported
try {
  baseten.imageModel('test-model');
} catch (error) {
  // Error: NoSuchModelError for imageModel
}
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the Hugging Face provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls, e.g. to use proxy servers.
  The default prefix is `https://router.huggingface.co/v1`.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header. It defaults to
  the `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` environment variable. You can get your API key
  from [Hugging Face Settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.

## Language Models

You can create language models using a provider instance:

```ts
import { huggingface } from '@ai-sdk/huggingface';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: huggingface('deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

You can also use the `.responses()` or `.languageModel()` factory methods:

```ts
const model = huggingface.responses('deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324');
// or
const model = huggingface.languageModel('moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct');
```

Hugging Face language models can be used in the `streamText` function
(see [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core)).

You can explore the latest and trending models with their capabilities, context size, throughput and pricing on the [Hugging Face Inference Models](https://huggingface.co/inference/models) page.

# Mistral AI Provider

The [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/) provider contains language model support for the Mistral chat API.

## Setup

The Mistral provider is available in the `@ai-sdk/mistral` module. You can install it with

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/mistral" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/mistral" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/mistral" dark />
</Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="bun add @ai-sdk/mistral" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `mistral` from `@ai-sdk/mistral`:

```ts
import { mistral } from '@ai-sdk/mistral';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createMistral` from `@ai-sdk/mistral`
and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createMistral } from '@ai-sdk/mistral';

const mistral = createMistral({
  // custom settings
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the Mistral provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls, e.g. to use proxy servers.
  The default prefix is `https://api.mistral.ai/v1`.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header.
  It defaults to the `MISTRAL_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  Defaults to the global `fetch` function.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

## Language Models

You can create models that call the [Mistral chat API](https://docs.mistral.ai/api/#operation/createChatCompletion) using a provider instance.
The first argument is the model id, e.g. `mistral-large-latest`.
Some Mistral chat models support tool calls.

```ts
const model = mistral('mistral-large-latest');
```

Mistral chat models also support additional model settings that are not part of the [standard call settings](/docs/ai-sdk-core/settings).
You can pass them as an options argument and utilize `MistralLanguageModelOptions` for typing:

```ts
import { mistral, type MistralLanguageModelOptions } from '@ai-sdk/mistral';
const model = mistral('mistral-large-latest');

await generateText({
  model,
  providerOptions: {
    mistral: {
      safePrompt: true, // optional safety prompt injection
      parallelToolCalls: false, // disable parallel tool calls (one tool per response)
    } satisfies MistralLanguageModelOptions,
  },
});
```

The following optional provider options are available for Mistral models:

- **safePrompt** _boolean_

  Whether to inject a safety prompt before all conversations.

  Defaults to `false`.

- **documentImageLimit** _number_

  Maximum number of images to process in a document.

- **documentPageLimit** _number_

  Maximum number of pages to process in a document.

- **strictJsonSchema** _boolean_

  Whether to use strict JSON schema validation for structured outputs. Only applies when a schema is provided and only sets the [`strict` flag](https://docs.mistral.ai/api/#tag/chat/operation/chat_completion_v1_chat_completions_post) in addition to using [Custom Structured Outputs](https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/structured-output/custom_structured_output/), which is used by default if a schema is provided.

  Defaults to `false`.

- **structuredOutputs** _boolean_

  Whether to use [structured outputs](#structured-outputs). When enabled, tool calls and object generation will be strict and follow the provided schema.

  Defaults to `true`.

- **parallelToolCalls** _boolean_

  Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use. When set to false, the model will use at most one tool per response.

  Defaults to `true`.

### Document OCR

Mistral chat models support document OCR for PDF files.
You can optionally set image and page limits using the provider options.

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: mistral('mistral-small-latest'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: 'What is an embedding model according to this document?',
        },
        {
          type: 'file',
          data: new URL(
            'https://github.com/vercel/ai/blob/main/examples/ai-core/data/ai.pdf?raw=true'
          ),
          mediaType: 'application/pdf',
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
  // optional settings:
  providerOptions: {
    mistral: {
      documentImageLimit: 8,
      documentPageLimit: 64,
    },
  },
});
```

### Reasoning Models

Mistral offers reasoning models that provide step-by-step thinking capabilities:

- **magistral-small-2506**: Smaller reasoning model for efficient step-by-step thinking
- **magistral-medium-2506**: More powerful reasoning model balancing performance and cost

These models return content that includes `<think>...</think>` tags containing the reasoning process. To properly extract and separate the reasoning from the final answer, use the [extract reasoning middleware](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/extract-reasoning-middleware):

```ts
import { mistral } from '@ai-sdk/mistral';
import {
  extractReasoningMiddleware,
  generateText,
  wrapLanguageModel,
} from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: wrapLanguageModel({
    model: mistral('magistral-small-2506'),
    middleware: extractReasoningMiddleware({
      tagName: 'think',
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'What is 15 * 24?',
});

console.log('REASONING:', result.reasoningText);
// Output: "Let me calculate this step by step..."

console.log('ANSWER:', result.text);
// Output: "360"
```

The middleware automatically parses the `<think>` tags and provides separate `reasoningText` and `text` properties in the result.

### Example

You can use Mistral language models to generate text with the `generateText` function:

```ts
import { mistral } from '@ai-sdk/mistral';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: mistral('mistral-large-latest'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

Mistral language models can also be used in the `streamText`, `generateObject`, and `streamObject` functions
(see [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core)).

#### Structured Outputs

Mistral chat models support structured outputs using JSON Schema. You can use `generateObject` or `streamObject`
with Zod, Valibot, or raw JSON Schema. The SDK sends your schema via Mistral's `response_format: { type: 'json_schema' }`.

```ts
import { mistral } from '@ai-sdk/mistral';
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const result = await generateObject({
  model: mistral('mistral-large-latest'),
  schema: z.object({
    recipe: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      ingredients: z.array(z.string()),
      instructions: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a simple pasta recipe.',
});

console.log(JSON.stringify(result.object, null, 2));
```

You can enable strict JSON Schema validation using a provider option:

```ts highlight="7-11"
import { mistral } from '@ai-sdk/mistral';
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const result = await generateObject({
  model: mistral('mistral-large-latest'),
  providerOptions: {
    mistral: {
      strictJsonSchema: true, // reject outputs that don't strictly match the schema
    },
  },
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    items: z.array(z.object({ id: z.string(), qty: z.number().int().min(1) })),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a small shopping list.',
});
```

<Note>
  When using structured outputs, the SDK no longer injects an extra "answer with
  JSON" instruction. It relies on Mistral's native `json_schema`/`json_object`
  response formats instead. You can customize the schema name/description via
  the standard structured-output APIs.
</Note>

</Note>

## Embedding Models

You can create models that call the [Mistral embeddings API](https://docs.mistral.ai/api/#operation/createEmbedding)
using the `.textEmbedding()` factory method.

```ts
const model = mistral.textEmbedding('mistral-embed');
```

You can use Mistral embedding models to generate embeddings with the `embed` function:

```ts
import { mistral } from '@ai-sdk/mistral';
import { embed } from 'ai';

const { embedding } = await embed({
  model: mistral.textEmbedding('mistral-embed'),
  value: 'sunny day at the beach',
});
```

# Together.ai Provider

The [Together.ai](https://together.ai) provider contains support for 200+ open-source models through the [Together.ai API](https://docs.together.ai/reference).

## Setup

The Together.ai provider is available via the `@ai-sdk/togetherai` module. You can
install it with

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/togetherai" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/togetherai" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/togetherai" dark />
</Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="bun add @ai-sdk/togetherai" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `togetherai` from `@ai-sdk/togetherai`:

```ts
import { togetherai } from '@ai-sdk/togetherai';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createTogetherAI` from `@ai-sdk/togetherai`
and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createTogetherAI } from '@ai-sdk/togetherai';

const togetherai = createTogetherAI({
  apiKey: process.env.TOGETHER_AI_API_KEY ?? '',
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the Together.ai provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls, e.g. to use proxy servers.
  The default prefix is `https://api.together.xyz/v1`.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header. It defaults to
  the `TOGETHER_AI_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  Defaults to the global `fetch` function.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

## Language Models

You can create [Together.ai models](https://docs.together.ai/docs/serverless-models) using a provider instance. The first argument is the model id, e.g. `google/gemma-2-9b-it`.

```ts
const model = togetherai('google/gemma-2-9b-it');
```

### Reasoning Models

Together.ai exposes the thinking of `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1` in the generated text using the `<think>` tag.
You can use the `extractReasoningMiddleware` to extract this reasoning and expose it as a `reasoning` property on the result:

```ts
import { togetherai } from '@ai-sdk/togetherai';
import { wrapLanguageModel, extractReasoningMiddleware } from 'ai';

const enhancedModel = wrapLanguageModel({
  model: togetherai('deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1'),
  middleware: extractReasoningMiddleware({ tagName: 'think' }),
});
```

You can then use that enhanced model in functions like `generateText` and `streamText`.

### Example

You can use Together.ai language models to generate text with the `generateText` function:

```ts
import { togetherai } from '@ai-sdk/togetherai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: togetherai('meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

Together.ai language models can also be used in the `streamText` function
(see [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core)).

The Together.ai provider also supports [completion models](https://docs.together.ai/docs/serverless-models#language-models) via (following the above example code) `togetherai.completion()` and [embedding models](https://docs.together.ai/docs/serverless-models#embedding-models) via `togetherai.textEmbedding()`.

const { images } = await generateImage({
  model: togetherai.image('black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev'),
  prompt: 'A delighted resplendent quetzal mid flight amidst raindrops',
});
```

You can pass optional provider-specific request parameters using the `providerOptions` argument.

```ts
import { togetherai } from '@ai-sdk/togetherai';
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';

const { images } = await generateImage({
  model: togetherai.image('black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev'),
  prompt: 'A delighted resplendent quetzal mid flight amidst raindrops',
  size: '512x512',
  // Optional additional provider-specific request parameters
  providerOptions: {
    togetherai: {
      steps: 40,
    },
  },
});
```

For a complete list of available provider-specific options, see the [Together.ai Image Generation API Reference](https://docs.together.ai/reference/post_images-generations).

### Model Capabilities

Together.ai image models support various image dimensions that vary by model. Common sizes include 512x512, 768x768, and 1024x1024, with some models supporting up to 1792x1792. The default size is 1024x1024.

## Reranking Models

You can create Together.ai reranking models using the `.reranking()` factory method.
For more on reranking with the AI SDK see [rerank()](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/rerank).

```ts
import { togetherai } from '@ai-sdk/togetherai';
import { rerank } from 'ai';

const documents = [
  'sunny day at the beach',
  'rainy afternoon in the city',
  'snowy night in the mountains',
];

const { ranking } = await rerank({
  model: togetherai.reranking('Salesforce/Llama-Rank-v1'),
  documents,
  query: 'talk about rain',
  topN: 2,
});

console.log(ranking);
// [
//   { originalIndex: 1, score: 0.9, document: 'rainy afternoon in the city' },
//   { originalIndex: 0, score: 0.3, document: 'sunny day at the beach' }
// ]
```

Together.ai reranking models support additional provider options for object documents. You can specify which fields to use for ranking:

```ts
import { togetherai } from '@ai-sdk/togetherai';
import { rerank } from 'ai';

const documents = [
  {
    from: 'Paul Doe',
    subject: 'Follow-up',
    text: 'We are happy to give you a discount of 20%.',
  },
  {
    from: 'John McGill',
    subject: 'Missing Info',
    text: 'Here is the pricing from Oracle: $5000/month',
  },
];

const { ranking } = await rerank({
  model: togetherai.reranking('Salesforce/Llama-Rank-v1'),
  documents,
  query: 'Which pricing did we get from Oracle?',
  providerOptions: {
    togetherai: {
      rankFields: ['from', 'subject', 'text'], // Specify which fields to rank by
    },
  },
});
```

The following provider options are available:

- **rankFields** _string[]_

  Array of field names to use for ranking when documents are JSON objects. If not specified, all fields are used.

# Cohere Provider

The [Cohere](https://cohere.com/) provider contains language and embedding model support for the Cohere chat API.

## Setup

The Cohere provider is available in the `@ai-sdk/cohere` module. You can install it with

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/cohere" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/cohere" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/cohere" dark />
</Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="bun add @ai-sdk/cohere" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `cohere` from `@ai-sdk/cohere`:

```ts
import { cohere } from '@ai-sdk/cohere';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createCohere` from `@ai-sdk/cohere`
and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createCohere } from '@ai-sdk/cohere';

const cohere = createCohere({
  // custom settings
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the Cohere provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls, e.g. to use proxy servers.
  The default prefix is `https://api.cohere.com/v2`.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header.
  It defaults to the `COHERE_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  Defaults to the global `fetch` function.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

## Language Models

You can create models that call the [Cohere chat API](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/chat-api) using a provider instance.
The first argument is the model id, e.g. `command-r-plus`.
Some Cohere chat models support tool calls.

```ts
const model = cohere('command-r-plus');
```

### Example

You can use Cohere language models to generate text with the `generateText` function:

```ts
import { cohere } from '@ai-sdk/cohere';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: cohere('command-r-plus'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

Cohere language models can also be used in the `streamText`, `generateObject`, and `streamObject` functions
(see [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core).

### Model Capabilities

| Model                         | Image Input         | Object Generation   | Tool Usage          | Tool Streaming      |

<Note>
  The table above lists popular models. Please see the [Cohere
  docs](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/models#command) for a full list of
  available models. You can also pass any available provider model ID as a
  string if needed.
</Note>

#### Reasoning

Cohere has introduced reasoning with the `command-a-reasoning-08-2025` model. You can learn more at https://docs.cohere.com/docs/reasoning.

```ts
import { cohere } from '@ai-sdk/cohere';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

async function main() {
  const { text, reasoning } = await generateText({
    model: cohere('command-a-reasoning-08-2025'),
    prompt:
      "Alice has 3 brothers and she also has 2 sisters. How many sisters does Alice's brother have?",
    // optional: reasoning options
    providerOptions: {
      cohere: {
        thinking: {
          type: 'enabled',
          tokenBudget: 100,
        },
      },
    },
  });

  console.log(reasoning);
  console.log(text);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## Embedding Models

You can create models that call the [Cohere embed API](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/reference/embed)
using the `.textEmbedding()` factory method.

```ts
const model = cohere.textEmbedding('embed-english-v3.0');
```

You can use Cohere embedding models to generate embeddings with the `embed` function:

```ts
import { cohere } from '@ai-sdk/cohere';
import { embed } from 'ai';

const { embedding } = await embed({
  model: cohere.textEmbedding('embed-english-v3.0'),
  value: 'sunny day at the beach',
  providerOptions: {
    cohere: {
      inputType: 'search_document',
    },
  },
});
```

Cohere embedding models support additional provider options that can be passed via `providerOptions.cohere`:

```ts
import { cohere } from '@ai-sdk/cohere';
import { embed } from 'ai';

const { embedding } = await embed({
  model: cohere.textEmbedding('embed-english-v3.0'),
  value: 'sunny day at the beach',
  providerOptions: {
    cohere: {
      inputType: 'search_document',
      truncate: 'END',
    },
  },
});
```

The following provider options are available:

- **inputType** _'search_document' | 'search_query' | 'classification' | 'clustering'_

  Specifies the type of input passed to the model. Default is `search_query`.

  - `search_document`: Used for embeddings stored in a vector database for search use-cases.
  - `search_query`: Used for embeddings of search queries run against a vector DB to find relevant documents.
  - `classification`: Used for embeddings passed through a text classifier.
  - `clustering`: Used for embeddings run through a clustering algorithm.

- **truncate** _'NONE' | 'START' | 'END'_

  Specifies how the API will handle inputs longer than the maximum token length.
  Default is `END`.

  - `NONE`: If selected, when the input exceeds the maximum input token length will return an error.
  - `START`: Will discard the start of the input until the remaining input is exactly the maximum input token length for the model.
  - `END`: Will discard the end of the input until the remaining input is exactly the maximum input token length for the model.

### Model Capabilities

| Model                           | Embedding Dimensions |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `embed-english-v3.0`            | 1024                 |
| `embed-multilingual-v3.0`       | 1024                 |
| `embed-english-light-v3.0`      | 384                  |
| `embed-multilingual-light-v3.0` | 384                  |
| `embed-english-v2.0`            | 4096                 |
| `embed-english-light-v2.0`      | 1024                 |
| `embed-multilingual-v2.0`       | 768                  |

## Reranking Models

You can create models that call the [Cohere rerank API](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/reference/rerank)
using the `.reranking()` factory method.

```ts
const model = cohere.reranking('rerank-v3.5');
```

You can use Cohere reranking models to rerank documents with the `rerank` function:

```ts
import { cohere } from '@ai-sdk/cohere';
import { rerank } from 'ai';

const documents = [
  'sunny day at the beach',
  'rainy afternoon in the city',
  'snowy night in the mountains',
];

const { ranking } = await rerank({
  model: cohere.reranking('rerank-v3.5'),
  documents,
  query: 'talk about rain',
  topN: 2,
});

console.log(ranking);
// [
//   { originalIndex: 1, score: 0.9, document: 'rainy afternoon in the city' },
//   { originalIndex: 0, score: 0.3, document: 'sunny day at the beach' }
// ]
```

Cohere reranking models support additional provider options that can be passed via `providerOptions.cohere`:

```ts
import { cohere } from '@ai-sdk/cohere';
import { rerank } from 'ai';

const { ranking } = await rerank({
  model: cohere.reranking('rerank-v3.5'),
  documents: ['sunny day at the beach', 'rainy afternoon in the city'],
  query: 'talk about rain',
  providerOptions: {
    cohere: {
      maxTokensPerDoc: 1000,
      priority: 1,
    },
  },
});
```

The following provider options are available:

- **maxTokensPerDoc** _number_

  Maximum number of tokens per document. Default is `4096`.

- **priority** _number_

  Priority of the request. Default is `0`.

### Model Capabilities

# Fireworks Provider

[Fireworks](https://fireworks.ai/) is a platform for running and testing LLMs through their [API](https://readme.fireworks.ai/).

## Setup

The Fireworks provider is available via the `@ai-sdk/fireworks` module. You can install it with

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/fireworks" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/fireworks" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/fireworks" dark />
</Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="bun add @ai-sdk/fireworks" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `fireworks` from `@ai-sdk/fireworks`:

```ts
import { fireworks } from '@ai-sdk/fireworks';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createFireworks` from `@ai-sdk/fireworks`
and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createFireworks } from '@ai-sdk/fireworks';

const fireworks = createFireworks({
  apiKey: process.env.FIREWORKS_API_KEY ?? '',
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the Fireworks provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls, e.g. to use proxy servers.
  The default prefix is `https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1`.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header. It defaults to
  the `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.

## Language Models

You can create [Fireworks models](https://fireworks.ai/models) using a provider instance.
The first argument is the model id, e.g. `accounts/fireworks/models/firefunction-v1`:

```ts
const model = fireworks('accounts/fireworks/models/firefunction-v1');
```

### Reasoning Models

Fireworks exposes the thinking of `deepseek-r1` in the generated text using the `<think>` tag.
You can use the `extractReasoningMiddleware` to extract this reasoning and expose it as a `reasoning` property on the result:

```ts
import { fireworks } from '@ai-sdk/fireworks';
import { wrapLanguageModel, extractReasoningMiddleware } from 'ai';

const enhancedModel = wrapLanguageModel({
  model: fireworks('accounts/fireworks/models/deepseek-r1'),
  middleware: extractReasoningMiddleware({ tagName: 'think' }),
});
```

You can then use that enhanced model in functions like `generateText` and `streamText`.

### Example

You can use Fireworks language models to generate text with the `generateText` function:

```ts
import { fireworks } from '@ai-sdk/fireworks';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: fireworks('accounts/fireworks/models/firefunction-v1'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

Fireworks language models can also be used in the `streamText` function
(see [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core)).

### Completion Models

You can create models that call the Fireworks completions API using the `.completion()` factory method:

```ts
const model = fireworks.completion('accounts/fireworks/models/firefunction-v1');
```

### Model Capabilities

| Model                                                      | Image Input         | Object Generation   | Tool Usage          | Tool Streaming      |

# DeepSeek Provider

The [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com) provider offers access to powerful language models through the DeepSeek API, including their [DeepSeek-V3 model](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3).

API keys can be obtained from the [DeepSeek Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys).

## Setup

The DeepSeek provider is available via the `@ai-sdk/deepseek` module. You can install it with:

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/deepseek" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/deepseek" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/deepseek" dark />
</Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="bun add @ai-sdk/deepseek" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `deepseek` from `@ai-sdk/deepseek`:

```ts
import { deepseek } from '@ai-sdk/deepseek';
```

For custom configuration, you can import `createDeepSeek` and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createDeepSeek } from '@ai-sdk/deepseek';

const deepseek = createDeepSeek({
  apiKey: process.env.DEEPSEEK_API_KEY ?? '',
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the DeepSeek provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls.
  The default prefix is `https://api.deepseek.com/v1`.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header. It defaults to
  the `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.

## Language Models

You can create language models using a provider instance:

```ts
import { deepseek } from '@ai-sdk/deepseek';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: deepseek('deepseek-chat'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

You can also use the `.chat()` or `.languageModel()` factory methods:

```ts
const model = deepseek.chat('deepseek-chat');
// or
const model = deepseek.languageModel('deepseek-chat');
```

DeepSeek language models can be used in the `streamText` function
(see [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core)).

### Reasoning

DeepSeek has reasoning support for the `deepseek-reasoner` model. The reasoning is exposed through streaming:

```ts
import { deepseek } from '@ai-sdk/deepseek';
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = streamText({
  model: deepseek('deepseek-reasoner'),
  prompt: 'How many "r"s are in the word "strawberry"?',
});

for await (const part of result.fullStream) {
  if (part.type === 'reasoning') {
    // This is the reasoning text
    console.log('Reasoning:', part.text);
  } else if (part.type === 'text') {
    // This is the final answer
    console.log('Answer:', part.text);
  }
}
```

See [AI SDK UI: Chatbot](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot#reasoning) for more details
on how to integrate reasoning into your chatbot.

### Cache Token Usage

DeepSeek provides context caching on disk technology that can significantly reduce token costs for repeated content. You can access the cache hit/miss metrics through the `providerMetadata` property in the response:

```ts
import { deepseek } from '@ai-sdk/deepseek';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: deepseek('deepseek-chat'),
  prompt: 'Your prompt here',
});

console.log(result.providerMetadata);
// Example output: { deepseek: { promptCacheHitTokens: 1856, promptCacheMissTokens: 5 } }
```

The metrics include:

- `promptCacheHitTokens`: Number of input tokens that were cached
- `promptCacheMissTokens`: Number of input tokens that were not cached

<Note>
  For more details about DeepSeek's caching system, see the [DeepSeek caching
  documentation](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/kv_cache#checking-cache-hit-status).
</Note>

# Perplexity Provider

The [Perplexity](https://sonar.perplexity.ai) provider offers access to Sonar API - a language model that uniquely combines real-time web search with natural language processing. Each response is grounded in current web data and includes detailed citations, making it ideal for research, fact-checking, and obtaining up-to-date information.

API keys can be obtained from the [Perplexity Platform](https://docs.perplexity.ai).

## Setup

The Perplexity provider is available via the `@ai-sdk/perplexity` module. You can install it with:

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/perplexity" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/perplexity" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/perplexity" dark />
</Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="bun add @ai-sdk/perplexity" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `perplexity` from `@ai-sdk/perplexity`:

```ts
import { perplexity } from '@ai-sdk/perplexity';
```

For custom configuration, you can import `createPerplexity` and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createPerplexity } from '@ai-sdk/perplexity';

const perplexity = createPerplexity({
  apiKey: process.env.PERPLEXITY_API_KEY ?? '',
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the Perplexity provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls.
  The default prefix is `https://api.perplexity.ai`.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header. It defaults to
  the `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.

## Language Models

You can create Perplexity models using a provider instance:

```ts
import { perplexity } from '@ai-sdk/perplexity';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: perplexity('sonar-pro'),
  prompt: 'What are the latest developments in quantum computing?',
});
```

### Sources

Websites that have been used to generate the response are included in the `sources` property of the result:

```ts
import { perplexity } from '@ai-sdk/perplexity';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text, sources } = await generateText({
  model: perplexity('sonar-pro'),
  prompt: 'What are the latest developments in quantum computing?',
});

console.log(sources);
```

### Provider Options & Metadata

The Perplexity provider includes additional metadata in the response through `providerMetadata`.
Additional configuration options are available through `providerOptions`.

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: perplexity('sonar-pro'),
  prompt: 'What are the latest developments in quantum computing?',
  providerOptions: {
    perplexity: {
      return_images: true, // Enable image responses (Tier-2 Perplexity users only)
    },
  },
});

console.log(result.providerMetadata);
// Example output:
// {
//   perplexity: {
//     usage: { citationTokens: 5286, numSearchQueries: 1 },
//     images: [
//       { imageUrl: "https://example.com/image1.jpg", originUrl: "https://elsewhere.com/page1", height: 1280, width: 720 },
//       { imageUrl: "https://example.com/image2.jpg", originUrl: "https://elsewhere.com/page2", height: 1280, width: 720 }
//     ]
//   },
// }
```

The metadata includes:

- `usage`: Object containing `citationTokens` and `numSearchQueries` metrics
- `images`: Array of image URLs when `return_images` is enabled (Tier-2 users only)

You can enable image responses by setting `return_images: true` in the provider options. This feature is only available to Perplexity Tier-2 users and above.

### PDF Support

The Perplexity provider supports reading PDF files.
You can pass PDF files as part of the message content using the `file` type:

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: perplexity('sonar-pro'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: 'What is this document about?',
        },
        {
          type: 'file',
          data: fs.readFileSync('./data/ai.pdf'),
          mediaType: 'application/pdf',
          filename: 'ai.pdf', // optional
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

You can also pass the URL of a PDF:

```ts
{
  type: 'file',
  data: new URL('https://example.com/document.pdf'),
  mediaType: 'application/pdf',
  filename: 'document.pdf', // optional
}
```

The model will have access to the contents of the PDF file and
respond to questions about it.

The Luma provider is available via the `@ai-sdk/luma` module. You can install it with

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/luma" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/luma" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/luma" dark />
</Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="bun add @ai-sdk/luma" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `luma` from `@ai-sdk/luma`:

```ts
import { luma } from '@ai-sdk/luma';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createLuma` and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createLuma } from '@ai-sdk/luma';

const luma = createLuma({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key', // optional, defaults to LUMA_API_KEY environment variable
  baseURL: 'custom-url', // optional
  headers: {
    /* custom headers */
  }, // optional
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the Luma provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls, e.g. to use proxy servers.
  The default prefix is `https://api.lumalabs.ai`.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header.
  It defaults to the `LUMA_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

## Image Models

You can create Luma image models using the `.image()` factory method.
For more on image generation with the AI SDK see [generateImage()](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-image).

### Basic Usage

```ts
import { luma } from '@ai-sdk/luma';
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';
import fs from 'fs';

const { image } = await generateImage({
  model: luma.image('photon-1'),
  prompt: 'A serene mountain landscape at sunset',
  aspectRatio: '16:9',
});

const filename = `image-${Date.now()}.png`;
fs.writeFileSync(filename, image.uint8Array);
console.log(`Image saved to ${filename}`);
```

### Image Model Settings

You can customize the generation behavior with optional settings:

```ts
const { image } = await generateImage({
  model: luma.image('photon-1'),
  prompt: 'A serene mountain landscape at sunset',
  aspectRatio: '16:9',
  maxImagesPerCall: 1, // Maximum number of images to generate per API call
  providerOptions: {
    luma: {
      pollIntervalMillis: 5000, // How often to check for completed images (in ms)
      maxPollAttempts: 10, // Maximum number of polling attempts before timeout
    },
  },
});
```

Since Luma processes images through an asynchronous queue system, these settings allow you to tune the polling behavior:

- **maxImagesPerCall** _number_

  Override the maximum number of images generated per API call. Defaults to 1.

- **pollIntervalMillis** _number_

  Control how frequently the API is checked for completed images while they are
  being processed. Defaults to 500ms.

- **maxPollAttempts** _number_

  Limit how long to wait for results before timing out, since image generation
  is queued asynchronously. Defaults to 120 attempts.

### Model Capabilities

Luma offers two main models:

| Model            | Description                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `photon-1`       | High-quality image generation with superior prompt understanding |
| `photon-flash-1` | Faster generation optimized for speed while maintaining quality  |

Both models support the following aspect ratios:

- 1:1
- 3:4
- 4:3
- 9:16
- 16:9 (default)
- 9:21
- 21:9

For more details about supported aspect ratios, see the [Luma Image Generation documentation](https://docs.lumalabs.ai/docs/image-generation).

Key features of Luma models include:

- Ultra-high quality image generation
- 10x higher cost efficiency compared to similar models
- Superior prompt understanding and adherence
- Unique character consistency capabilities from single reference images
- Multi-image reference support for precise style matching

### Advanced Options

Luma models support several advanced features through the `providerOptions.luma` parameter.

#### Image Reference

Use up to 4 reference images to guide your generation. Useful for creating variations or visualizing complex concepts. Adjust the `weight` (0-1) to control the influence of reference images.

```ts
// Example: Generate a salamander with reference
await generateImage({
  model: luma.image('photon-1'),
  prompt: 'A salamander at dusk in a forest pond, in the style of ukiyo-e',
  providerOptions: {
    luma: {
      image_ref: [
        {
          url: 'https://example.com/reference.jpg',
          weight: 0.85,
        },
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

#### Style Reference

Apply specific visual styles to your generations using reference images. Control the style influence using the `weight` parameter.

```ts
// Example: Generate with style reference
await generateImage({
  model: luma.image('photon-1'),
  prompt: 'A blue cream Persian cat launching its website on Vercel',
  providerOptions: {
    luma: {
      style_ref: [
        {
          url: 'https://example.com/style.jpg',
          weight: 0.8,
        },
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

#### Character Reference

Create consistent and personalized characters using up to 4 reference images of the same subject. More reference images improve character representation.

```ts
// Example: Generate character-based image
await generateImage({
  model: luma.image('photon-1'),
  prompt: 'A woman with a cat riding a broomstick in a forest',
  providerOptions: {
    luma: {
      character_ref: {
        identity0: {
          images: ['https://example.com/character.jpg'],
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

#### Modify Image

Transform existing images using text prompts. Use the `weight` parameter to control how closely the result matches the input image (higher weight = closer to input but less creative).

<Note>
  For color changes, it's recommended to use a lower weight value (0.0-0.1).
</Note>

```ts
// Example: Modify existing image
await generateImage({
  model: luma.image('photon-1'),
  prompt: 'transform the bike to a boat',
  providerOptions: {
    luma: {
      modify_image_ref: {
        url: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',
        weight: 1.0,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="bun add @ai-sdk/elevenlabs" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `elevenlabs` from `@ai-sdk/elevenlabs`:

```ts
import { elevenlabs } from '@ai-sdk/elevenlabs';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createElevenLabs` from `@ai-sdk/elevenlabs` and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createElevenLabs } from '@ai-sdk/elevenlabs';

const elevenlabs = createElevenLabs({
  // custom settings, e.g.
  fetch: customFetch,
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the ElevenLabs provider instance:

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header.
  It defaults to the `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  Defaults to the global `fetch` function.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

## Speech Models

You can create models that call the [ElevenLabs speech API](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech)
using the `.speech()` factory method.

The first argument is the model id e.g. `eleven_multilingual_v2`.

```ts
const model = elevenlabs.speech('eleven_multilingual_v2');
```

You can also pass additional provider-specific options using the `providerOptions` argument. For example, supplying a voice to use for the generated audio.

```ts highlight="6"
import { experimental_generateSpeech as generateSpeech } from 'ai';
import { elevenlabs } from '@ai-sdk/elevenlabs';

const result = await generateSpeech({
  model: elevenlabs.speech('eleven_multilingual_v2'),
  text: 'Hello, world!',
  providerOptions: { elevenlabs: {} },
});
```

- **language_code** _string or null_  
  Optional. Language code (ISO 639-1) used to enforce a language for the model. Currently, only Turbo v2.5 and Flash v2.5 support language enforcement. For other models, providing a language code will result in an error.

- **voice_settings** _object or null_  
  Optional. Voice settings that override stored settings for the given voice. These are applied only to the current request.

  - **stability** _double or null_  
    Optional. Determines how stable the voice is and the randomness between each generation. Lower values introduce broader emotional range; higher values result in a more monotonous voice.
  - **use_speaker_boost** _boolean or null_  
    Optional. Boosts similarity to the original speaker. Increases computational load and latency.
  - **similarity_boost** _double or null_  
    Optional. Controls how closely the AI should adhere to the original voice.
  - **style** _double or null_  
    Optional. Amplifies the style of the original speaker. May increase latency if set above 0.

- **pronunciation_dictionary_locators** _array of objects or null_  
  Optional. A list of pronunciation dictionary locators to apply to the text, in order. Up to 3 locators per request.  
  Each locator object:

  - **pronunciation_dictionary_id** _string_ (required)  
    The ID of the pronunciation dictionary.
  - **version_id** _string or null_ (optional)  
    The version ID of the dictionary. If not provided, the latest version is used.

- **seed** _integer or null_  
  Optional. If specified, the system will attempt to sample deterministically. Must be between 0 and 4294967295. Determinism is not guaranteed.

- **previous_text** _string or null_  
  Optional. The text that came before the current request's text. Can improve continuity when concatenating generations or influence current generation continuity.

- **next_text** _string or null_  
  Optional. The text that comes after the current request's text. Can improve continuity when concatenating generations or influence current generation continuity.

- **previous_request_ids** _array of strings or null_  
  Optional. List of request IDs for samples generated before this one. Improves continuity when splitting large tasks. Max 3 IDs. If both `previous_text` and `previous_request_ids` are sent, `previous_text` is ignored.

- **next_request_ids** _array of strings or null_  
  Optional. List of request IDs for samples generated after this one. Useful for maintaining continuity when regenerating a sample. Max 3 IDs. If both `next_text` and `next_request_ids` are sent, `next_text` is ignored.

- **apply_text_normalization** _enum_  
  Optional. Controls text normalization.  
  Allowed values: `'auto'` (default), `'on'`, `'off'`.

  - `'auto'`: System decides whether to apply normalization (e.g., spelling out numbers).
  - `'on'`: Always apply normalization.
  - `'off'`: Never apply normalization.  
    For `eleven_turbo_v2_5` and `eleven_flash_v2_5`, can only be enabled with Enterprise plans.

- **apply_language_text_normalization** _boolean_  
  Optional. Defaults to `false`. Controls language text normalization, which helps with proper pronunciation in some supported languages (currently only Japanese). May significantly increase latency.

### Model Capabilities

| Model                    | Instructions        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| `eleven_v3`              | <Check size={18} /> |

| `eleven_monolingual_v1`  | <Check size={18} /> |
| `eleven_multilingual_v1` | <Check size={18} /> |

## Transcription Models

You can create models that call the [ElevenLabs transcription API](https://elevenlabs.io/speech-to-text)
using the `.transcription()` factory method.

The first argument is the model id e.g. `scribe_v1`.

```ts
const model = elevenlabs.transcription('scribe_v1');
```

You can also pass additional provider-specific options using the `providerOptions` argument. For example, supplying the input language in ISO-639-1 (e.g. `en`) format can sometimes improve transcription performance if known beforehand.

```ts highlight="6"
import { experimental_transcribe as transcribe } from 'ai';
import { elevenlabs } from '@ai-sdk/elevenlabs';

const result = await transcribe({
  model: elevenlabs.transcription('scribe_v1'),
  audio: new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3, 4]),
  providerOptions: { elevenlabs: { languageCode: 'en' } },
});
```

The following provider options are available:

- **languageCode** _string_

  An ISO-639-1 or ISO-639-3 language code corresponding to the language of the audio file.
  Can sometimes improve transcription performance if known beforehand.
  Defaults to `null`, in which case the language is predicted automatically.

- **tagAudioEvents** _boolean_

  Whether to tag audio events like (laughter), (footsteps), etc. in the transcription.
  Defaults to `true`.

- **numSpeakers** _integer_

  The maximum amount of speakers talking in the uploaded file.
  Can help with predicting who speaks when.
  The maximum amount of speakers that can be predicted is 32.
  Defaults to `null`, in which case the amount of speakers is set to the maximum value the model supports.

- **timestampsGranularity** _enum_

  The granularity of the timestamps in the transcription.
  Defaults to `'word'`.
  Allowed values: `'none'`, `'word'`, `'character'`.

- **diarize** _boolean_

  Whether to annotate which speaker is currently talking in the uploaded file.
  Defaults to `true`.

- **fileFormat** _enum_

  The format of input audio.
  Defaults to `'other'`.
  Allowed values: `'pcm_s16le_16'`, `'other'`.
  For `'pcm_s16le_16'`, the input audio must be 16-bit PCM at a 16kHz sample rate, single channel (mono), and little-endian byte order.
  Latency will be lower than with passing an encoded waveform.

### Model Capabilities

| Model                    | Transcription       | Duration            | Segments            | Language            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |

# LM Studio Provider

[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) is a user interface for running local models.

It contains an OpenAI compatible API server that you can use with the AI SDK.
You can start the local server under the [Local Server tab](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/basics/server) in the LM Studio UI ("Start Server" button).

## Setup

The LM Studio provider is available via the `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` module as it is compatible with the OpenAI API.
You can install it with

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/openai-compatible" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/openai-compatible" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/openai-compatible" dark />
</Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="bun add @ai-sdk/openai-compatible" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Provider Instance

To use LM Studio, you can create a custom provider instance with the `createOpenAICompatible` function from `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`:

```ts
import { createOpenAICompatible } from '@ai-sdk/openai-compatible';

const lmstudio = createOpenAICompatible({
  name: 'lmstudio',
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:1234/v1',
});
```

<Note>
  LM Studio uses port `1234` by default, but you can change in the [app's Local
  Server tab](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/basics/server).
</Note>

## Language Models

You can interact with local LLMs in [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/basics/server#endpoints-overview) using a provider instance.
The first argument is the model id, e.g. `llama-3.2-1b`.

```ts
const model = lmstudio('llama-3.2-1b');
```

###### To be able to use a model, you need to [download it first](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/basics/download-model).

### Example

You can use LM Studio language models to generate text with the `generateText` function:

```ts
import { createOpenAICompatible } from '@ai-sdk/openai-compatible';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const lmstudio = createOpenAICompatible({
  name: 'lmstudio',
  baseURL: 'https://localhost:1234/v1',
});

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: lmstudio('llama-3.2-1b'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
  maxRetries: 1, // immediately error if the server is not running
});
```

LM Studio language models can also be used with `streamText`.

## Embedding Models

You can create models that call the [LM Studio embeddings API](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/basics/server#endpoints-overview)
using the `.textEmbeddingModel()` factory method.

```ts
const model = lmstudio.textEmbeddingModel(
  'text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5'
);
```

### Example - Embedding a Single Value

```tsx
import { createOpenAICompatible } from '@ai-sdk/openai-compatible';
import { embed } from 'ai';

const lmstudio = createOpenAICompatible({
  name: 'lmstudio',
  baseURL: 'https://localhost:1234/v1',
});

// 'embedding' is a single embedding object (number[])
const { embedding } = await embed({
  model: lmstudio.textEmbeddingModel('text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5'),
  value: 'sunny day at the beach',
});
```

### Example - Embedding Many Values

When loading data, e.g. when preparing a data store for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
it is often useful to embed many values at once (batch embedding).

The AI SDK provides the [`embedMany`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/embed-many) function for this purpose.
Similar to `embed`, you can use it with embeddings models,
e.g. `lmstudio.textEmbeddingModel('text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5')` or `lmstudio.textEmbeddingModel('text-embedding-bge-small-en-v1.5')`.

```tsx
import { createOpenAICompatible } from '@ai-sdk/openai-compatible';
import { embedMany } from 'ai';

const lmstudio = createOpenAICompatible({
  name: 'lmstudio',
  baseURL: 'https://localhost:1234/v1',
});

// 'embeddings' is an array of embedding objects (number[][]).
// It is sorted in the same order as the input values.
const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
  model: lmstudio.textEmbeddingModel('text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5'),
  values: [
    'sunny day at the beach',
    'rainy afternoon in the city',
    'snowy night in the mountains',
  ],
});
```

    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.NIM_API_KEY}`,
  },
});

const { text, usage, finishReason } = await generateText({
  model: nim.chatModel('deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1'),
  prompt: 'Tell me the history of the San Francisco Mission-style burrito.',
});

console.log(text);
console.log('Token usage:', usage);
console.log('Finish reason:', finishReason);
```

### Example - Stream Text

NIM language models can also generate text in a streaming fashion with the `streamText` function:

```ts
import { createOpenAICompatible } from '@ai-sdk/openai-compatible';
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const nim = createOpenAICompatible({
  name: 'nim',
  baseURL: 'https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1',
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.NIM_API_KEY}`,
  },
});

const result = streamText({
  model: nim.chatModel('deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1'),
  prompt: 'Tell me the history of the Northern White Rhino.',
});

for await (const textPart of result.textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(textPart);
}

console.log();
console.log('Token usage:', await result.usage);
console.log('Finish reason:', await result.finishReason);
```

NIM language models can also be used with other AI SDK functions like `generateObject` and `streamObject`.

<Note>
  Model support for tool calls and structured object generation varies. For
  example, the
  [`meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct`](https://build.nvidia.com/meta/llama-3_3-70b-instruct)
  model supports object generation capabilities. Check each model's
  documentation on NVIDIA Build for specific supported features.

  apiKey: process.env.INFERENCE_KEY,
});
```

Be sure to have your `INFERENCE_KEY`, `INFERENCE_MODEL_ID`, and `INFERENCE_URL` set in your environment variables.

## Language Models

You can create Heroku models using a provider instance.
The first argument is the served model name, e.g. `claude-3-5-haiku`.

```ts
const model = heroku('claude-3-5-haiku');
```

### Example

You can use Heroku language models to generate text with the `generateText` function:

```ts
import { createOpenAICompatible } from '@ai-sdk/openai-compatible';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const heroku = createOpenAICompatible({
  name: 'heroku',
  baseURL: process.env.INFERENCE_URL + '/v1',
  apiKey: process.env.INFERENCE_KEY,
});

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: heroku('claude-3-5-haiku'),
  prompt: 'Tell me about yourself in one sentence',
});

console.log(text);
```

Heroku language models are also able to generate text in a streaming fashion with the `streamText` function:

```ts
import { createOpenAICompatible } from '@ai-sdk/openai-compatible';
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const heroku = createOpenAICompatible({
  name: 'heroku',
  baseURL: process.env.INFERENCE_URL + '/v1',
  apiKey: process.env.INFERENCE_KEY,
});

const result = streamText({
  model: heroku('claude-3-5-haiku'),
  prompt: 'Tell me about yourself in one sentence',
});

for await (const message of result.textStream) {
  console.log(message);
}
```

Heroku language models can also be used in the `generateObject`, and `streamObject` functions.

# OpenAI Compatible Providers

You can use the [OpenAI Compatible Provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ai-sdk/openai-compatible) package to use language model providers that implement the OpenAI API.

Below we focus on the general setup and provider instance creation. You can also [write a custom provider package leveraging the OpenAI Compatible package](/providers/openai-compatible-providers/custom-providers).

We provide detailed documentation for the following OpenAI compatible providers:

- [LM Studio](/providers/openai-compatible-providers/lmstudio)
- [NIM](/providers/openai-compatible-providers/nim)
- [Heroku](/providers/openai-compatible-providers/heroku)

The general setup and provider instance creation is the same for all of these providers.

## Setup

The OpenAI Compatible provider is available via the `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` module. You can install it with:

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/openai-compatible" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/openai-compatible" dark />
</Tab>
<Tab>
<Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/openai-compatible" dark />
</Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="bun add @ai-sdk/openai-compatible" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Provider Instance

To use an OpenAI compatible provider, you can create a custom provider instance with the `createOpenAICompatible` function from `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`:

```ts
import { createOpenAICompatible } from '@ai-sdk/openai-compatible';

const provider = createOpenAICompatible({
  name: 'provider-name',
  apiKey: process.env.PROVIDER_API_KEY,
  baseURL: 'https://api.provider.com/v1',
  includeUsage: true, // Include usage information in streaming responses
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Set the URL prefix for API calls.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key for authenticating requests. If specified, adds an `Authorization`
  header to request headers with the value `Bearer <apiKey>`. This will be added
  before any headers potentially specified in the `headers` option.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Optional custom headers to include in requests. These will be added to request headers
  after any headers potentially added by use of the `apiKey` option.

- **queryParams** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Optional custom url query parameters to include in request urls.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  Defaults to the global `fetch` function.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

- **includeUsage** _boolean_

  Include usage information in streaming responses. When enabled, usage data will be included in the response metadata for streaming requests. Defaults to `undefined` (`false`).

- **supportsStructuredOutputs** _boolean_

  Set to true if the provider supports structured outputs. Only relevant for `provider()`, `provider.chatModel()`, and `provider.languageModel()`.

## Language Models

You can create provider models using a provider instance.
The first argument is the model id, e.g. `model-id`.

```ts
const model = provider('model-id');
```

### Example

You can use provider language models to generate text with the `generateText` function:

```ts
import { createOpenAICompatible } from '@ai-sdk/openai-compatible';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const provider = createOpenAICompatible({
  name: 'provider-name',
  apiKey: process.env.PROVIDER_API_KEY,
  baseURL: 'https://api.provider.com/v1',
});

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: provider('model-id'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

### Including model ids for auto-completion

```ts
import { createOpenAICompatible } from '@ai-sdk/openai-compatible';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

type ExampleChatModelIds =
  | 'meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf'
  | 'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo'
  | (string & {});

type ExampleCompletionModelIds =
  | 'codellama/CodeLlama-34b-Instruct-hf'
  | 'Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct'
  | (string & {});

type ExampleEmbeddingModelIds =
  | 'BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5'
  | 'bert-base-uncased'
  | (string & {});

const model = createOpenAICompatible<
  ExampleChatModelIds,
  ExampleCompletionModelIds,
  ExampleEmbeddingModelIds
>({
  name: 'example',
  apiKey: process.env.PROVIDER_API_KEY,
  baseURL: 'https://api.example.com/v1',
});

// Subsequent calls to e.g. `model.chatModel` will auto-complete the model id
// from the list of `ExampleChatModelIds` while still allowing free-form
// strings as well.

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: model.chatModel('meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

### Custom query parameters

Some providers may require custom query parameters. An example is the [Azure AI
Model Inference
API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/reference-model-inference-chat-completions?view=azureml-api-2)
which requires an `api-version` query parameter.

You can set these via the optional `queryParams` provider setting. These will be
added to all requests made by the provider.

```ts highlight="7-9"
import { createOpenAICompatible } from '@ai-sdk/openai-compatible';

const provider = createOpenAICompatible({
  name: 'provider-name',
  apiKey: process.env.PROVIDER_API_KEY,
  baseURL: 'https://api.provider.com/v1',
  queryParams: {
    'api-version': '1.0.0',
  },
});
```

For example, with the above configuration, API requests would include the query parameter in the URL like:
`https://api.provider.com/v1/chat/completions?api-version=1.0.0`.

## Provider-specific options

The OpenAI Compatible provider supports adding provider-specific options to the request body. These are specified with the `providerOptions` field in the request body.

For example, if you create a provider instance with the name `provider-name`, you can add a `custom-option` field to the request body like this:

```ts
const provider = createOpenAICompatible({
  name: 'provider-name',
  apiKey: process.env.PROVIDER_API_KEY,
  baseURL: 'https://api.provider.com/v1',
});

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: provider('model-id'),
  prompt: 'Hello',
  providerOptions: {
    'provider-name': { customOption: 'magic-value' },
  },
});
```

The request body sent to the provider will include the `customOption` field with the value `magic-value`. This gives you an easy way to add provider-specific options to requests without having to modify the provider or AI SDK code.

## Custom Metadata Extraction

The OpenAI Compatible provider supports extracting provider-specific metadata from API responses through metadata extractors.
These extractors allow you to capture additional information returned by the provider beyond the standard response format.

Metadata extractors receive the raw, unprocessed response data from the provider, giving you complete flexibility
to extract any custom fields or experimental features that the provider may include.
This is particularly useful when:

- Working with providers that include non-standard response fields
- Experimenting with beta or preview features
- Capturing provider-specific metrics or debugging information
- Supporting rapid provider API evolution without SDK changes

Metadata extractors work with both streaming and non-streaming chat completions and consist of two main components:

1. A function to extract metadata from complete responses
2. A streaming extractor that can accumulate metadata across chunks in a streaming response

Here's an example metadata extractor that captures both standard and custom provider data:

```typescript
const myMetadataExtractor: MetadataExtractor = {
  // Process complete, non-streaming responses
  extractMetadata: ({ parsedBody }) => {
    // You have access to the complete raw response
    // Extract any fields the provider includes
    return {
      myProvider: {
        standardUsage: parsedBody.usage,
        experimentalFeatures: parsedBody.beta_features,
        customMetrics: {
          processingTime: parsedBody.server_timing?.total_ms,
          modelVersion: parsedBody.model_version,
          // ... any other provider-specific data
        },
      },
    };
  },

  // Process streaming responses
  createStreamExtractor: () => {
    let accumulatedData = {
      timing: [],
      customFields: {},
    };

    return {
      // Process each chunk's raw data
      processChunk: (parsedChunk) => {
        if (parsedChunk.server_timing) {
          accumulatedData.timing.push(parsedChunk.server_timing);
        }
        if (parsedChunk.custom_data) {
          Object.assign(accumulatedData.customFields, parsedChunk.custom_data);
        }
      },
      // Build final metadata from accumulated data
      buildMetadata: () => ({
        myProvider: {
          streamTiming: accumulatedData.timing,
          customData: accumulatedData.customFields,
        },
      }),
    };
  },
};
```

You can provide a metadata extractor when creating your provider instance:

```typescript
const provider = createOpenAICompatible({
  name: 'my-provider',
  apiKey: process.env.PROVIDER_API_KEY,
  baseURL: 'https://api.provider.com/v1',
  metadataExtractor: myMetadataExtractor,
});
```

The extracted metadata will be included in the response under the `providerMetadata` field:

```typescript
const { text, providerMetadata } = await generateText({
  model: provider('model-id'),
  prompt: 'Hello',
});

console.log(providerMetadata.myProvider.customMetric);
```

This allows you to access provider-specific information while maintaining a consistent interface across different providers.
