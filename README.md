## AI

This repo contains some fun examples of AI/LLM usage. Each feature can be reached by simply appending your normal hosted url with the following;

### Jobs

This project creates embeddings out of Hacker News Who Is Hiring post, it then generates an embedding of your resume. Then uses vector similarity matching to recommend what jobs would be most applicable to you.

It is not setup to be automated at the moment, and the formatting is garbage. Each post should be sent to GPT to reformat it into a templated job description before generating embeddings.

### Letter

This is a very simple service that prompts GPT with your resume and asks to generate a cover letter.

It could be easily improved to also contain the context of the job you are applying for.

### Suggestions

This is a very simple service that prompts GPT with your resume and asks to generate a list of suggestions for you to improve your resume.

### Interview

This is an implementation of a chat bot, your resume is injected, and the conversation is included in the prompt. So you can interview your self or talk as if you were being interviewed.
