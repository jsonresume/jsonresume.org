# Job Board System

The JSON Resume platform includes an AI-powered job board that scrapes, processes, and indexes job postings from Hacker News.

## Overview

The job board system consists of three main components:

1. **Job Scraping** - Automatically fetch jobs from HN "Who is Hiring?" threads
2. **AI Processing** - Parse and enrich jobs using OpenAI GPT-5-mini
3. **Vector Search** - Enable semantic job matching with Pinecone

## Architecture

For detailed architecture documentation, see the [Job Processing Pipeline README](https://github.com/jsonresume/jsonresume.org/blob/master/scripts/jobs/README.md).

## Features

- Daily automated job scraping via GitHub Actions
- AI-powered job parsing with structured data extraction
- Company enrichment with external data sources
- Natural language job descriptions
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Resume-to-job matching

## Quick Start

### Running Locally

```bash
cd apps/registry

# Step 1: Fetch HN jobs
node scripts/jobs/getLatestWhoIsHiring.js

# Step 2: Process with AI (uses GPT-5-mini)
node scripts/jobs/gpted.js

# Step 3: Vectorize for search
node scripts/jobs/vectorize.js
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...           # OpenAI API key
SUPABASE_KEY=eyJ...             # Supabase service role key
PINECONE_API_KEY=...            # Pinecone API key
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=...        # Pinecone environment
```

## Automation

The job processing pipeline runs automatically via GitHub Actions:

- **Schedule**: Daily at 9 AM UTC
- **Manual Trigger**: Available via GitHub UI
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Discord notifications on failure
  - Auto-creates GitHub issues for repeated failures
  - Workflow summary with processing stats
  - Log artifacts for debugging

See the [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/jsonresume/jsonresume.org/blob/master/.github/workflows/process-hn-jobs.yml) for implementation details.

## Data Flow

```
HN API → Raw Jobs (Supabase)
          ↓
    AI Processing (GPT-5-mini)
          ↓
  Structured JSON (gpt_content column)
          ↓
   Vector Embeddings (Pinecone)
          ↓
    Semantic Search
```

## Monitoring

View recent jobs and processing status:

```sql
SELECT
  uuid,
  hn_item_id,
  posted_at,
  CASE
    WHEN gpt_content IS NULL THEN 'Pending'
    WHEN gpt_content = 'FAILED' THEN 'Failed'
    ELSE 'Processed'
  END as status
FROM jobs
ORDER BY posted_at DESC
LIMIT 100;
```
