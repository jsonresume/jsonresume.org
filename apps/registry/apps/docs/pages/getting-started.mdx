## Creating Your First Resume

### 1. Initialize

Create a new resume.json file:

```bash
resume init
```

This will create a resume.json file with sample data.

### 2. Edit Your Resume

Open `resume.json` and update it with your information. Here's the structure:

```json
{
  "basics": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "label": "Your Title",
    "email": "your.email@example.com",
    "phone": "(555) 123-4567",

    "summary": "A brief summary about you...",
    "location": {
      "city": "Your City",
      "countryCode": "US",
      "region": "California"
    },
    "profiles": [
      {
        "network": "GitHub",
        "username": "yourusername",
        "url": "https://github.com/yourusername"
      }
    ]
  },

  "skills": [],
  "projects": [],
  "awards": [],
  "publications": [],
  "volunteer": [],
  "languages": [],
  "interests": [],
  "references": []
}
```

### 3. Preview

Preview your resume:

```bash
resume serve
```

This will start a local server and open your resume in your browser.

### 4. Export

Export to PDF or HTML:

```bash
# Export to PDF
resume export resume.pdf

# Export to HTML
resume export resume.html
```

## Publishing Your Resume

### Using GitHub Gist

1. Create a new **public** gist at [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com)
2. Name the file `resume.json`
3. Paste your resume data
4. Save the gist
5. Your resume will be available at `https://registry.jsonresume.org/{your-github-username}`

### Example

If your GitHub username is `johndoe`, your resume will be at:

```
https://registry.jsonresume.org/johndoe
```

## Themes

JSON Resume supports multiple themes. To use a different theme:

```bash
# List available themes
resume serve --theme [theme-name]

# Example with different themes
resume serve --theme elegant
resume serve --theme professional
resume serve --theme modern
```

## Validation

Validate your resume against the JSON Resume schema:

```bash
resume validate
```

This will check for required fields and proper formatting.
