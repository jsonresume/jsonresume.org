## The Standard

JSON Resume follows a standardized schema defined at [jsonresume.org/schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema). Here's a minimal example:

```json
{
  "basics": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "label": "Software Engineer",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "summary": "A passionate software engineer...",
    "location": {
      "city": "San Francisco",
      "countryCode": "US"
    },
    "profiles": [
      {
        "network": "GitHub",
        "username": "johndoe",
        "url": "https://github.com/johndoe"
      }
    ]
  },
  "work": [
    {
      "company": "Example Corp",
      "position": "Software Engineer",
      "startDate": "2020-01-01",
      "highlights": ["Built scalable microservices", "Led team of 5 engineers"]
    }
  ],
  "education": [
    {
      "institution": "University of Example",
      "area": "Computer Science",
      "studyType": "Bachelor",
      "endDate": "2019-05-01"
    }
  ],
  "skills": [
    {
      "name": "Web Development",
      "keywords": ["JavaScript", "React", "Node.js"]
    }
  ]
}
```
