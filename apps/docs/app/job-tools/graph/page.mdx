# Job Graph

An interactive network visualization that places your resume at the center and connects it to matched jobs, showing relationships between positions using React Flow.

## How to Access

- **URL**: `registry.jsonresume.org/{username}/jobs-graph`
- **Auth**: Public (uses your public resume data)

## Features

### Network Visualization

The graph displays:

- **Your resume** as the central node
- **Job postings** as connected nodes, positioned by similarity
- **Edges** connecting your resume to each job, with closer nodes being better matches
- **Clusters** of similar jobs naturally group together

### Salary Gradient

Toggle the salary gradient overlay to color-code nodes by compensation:

- Nodes are colored from cool (lower salary) to warm (higher salary)
- Salary range slider lets you filter by compensation band
- Jobs without salary data are shown in a neutral color

### Filtering

| Filter             | Description                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Text search**    | Filter jobs by keyword in title or description |
| **Remote only**    | Show only remote-friendly positions            |
| **Salary range**   | Slider to filter by compensation               |
| **Show/hide read** | Toggle visibility of already-reviewed jobs     |

### Keyboard Navigation

Navigate the graph without a mouse:

| Key            | Action                        |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Arrow keys** | Move between connected nodes  |
| **M**          | Mark the selected job as read |

### Node Interaction

- **Click** a node to select it and see full job details
- **Hover** to highlight the connection path to your resume
- **Drag** nodes to rearrange the layout
- **Scroll** to zoom in and out
- **Pan** by dragging the background

### Read Tracking

Jobs marked as read are visually dimmed. Hidden by default to keep the graph focused on new opportunities. Toggle "Show hidden" to see them.

## Usage Guide

1. Navigate to `registry.jsonresume.org/{username}/jobs-graph`
2. Wait for the graph to load (it processes all job matches)
3. Explore clusters of similar jobs near each other
4. Click on nodes to see detailed job descriptions
5. Use the salary gradient to identify high-paying opportunities
6. Filter by text or remote status to narrow results
7. Use keyboard arrows to navigate between nodes

## Tips & Best Practices

- Zoom out first to see the full graph structure, then zoom into clusters of interest
- The salary gradient helps quickly identify compensation outliers
- Use text filtering to find specific technologies or company types
- Mark jobs as read as you review them to keep the graph focused
- Path highlighting shows how a job relates back to your resume
