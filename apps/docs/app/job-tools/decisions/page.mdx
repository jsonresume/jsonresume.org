An AI-powered job evaluation tool with a three-pane layout: your resume, an animated decision tree, and ranked job listings.

## How to Access

- **URL**: `registry.jsonresume.org/{username}/decisions`
- **Auth**: Public (uses your public resume data, login for saving decisions)

## Features

### Three-Pane Layout

| Pane             | Width          | Content                                         |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Left** (25%)   | Resume display | Your resume summary with preference controls    |
| **Center** (50%) | Decision tree  | React Flow visualization of evaluation criteria |
| **Right** (25%)  | Ranked jobs    | AI-scored job listings                          |

### Decision Tree Visualization

When you select a job, the center pane shows an animated decision tree that evaluates the job against your resume across multiple criteria:

- **Skills Match** — How well your skills align with the job requirements
- **Experience Level** — Whether your experience matches the seniority expected
- **Location** — Geographic compatibility including remote status
- **Salary Range** — Compensation alignment with market data
- **Industry Fit** — Sector and domain relevance
- **Growth Potential** — Career development opportunities
- **Culture Fit** — Company values and work style compatibility
- **Technical Stack** — Specific technology overlap

Each criterion node animates green (pass) or red (fail) as the evaluation runs, building a visual picture of the job's fit.

### Preference Controls

Customize evaluation weights from the resume pane:

- Enable/disable specific criteria
- Adjust importance of each factor
- The ranked list and decision tree update in real-time

### Job Rankings

Jobs are ranked by a composite score derived from all enabled criteria. Select any job to trigger the decision tree evaluation and see a detailed breakdown.

### Decision Persistence

When logged in, record your decisions (interested / not interested) on each job. Decided jobs are filtered from future views.

## Usage Guide

1. Navigate to `registry.jsonresume.org/{username}/decisions`
2. Review your resume summary in the left pane
3. Adjust preference weights if needed
4. Click on a job in the right pane to evaluate it
5. Watch the decision tree animate through each criterion
6. Record your decision to filter it from future lists
