# Job Matching

The job matching page shows a ranked list of jobs from Hacker News "Who is Hiring?" threads, scored by semantic similarity to your JSON Resume.

## How to Access

- **URL**: `registry.jsonresume.org/{username}/jobs`
- **Auth**: Public (uses your public resume data)

## Features

### Similarity-Ranked Results

Jobs are ranked by cosine similarity between your resume's vector embedding and each job's embedding. The most relevant jobs appear at the top.

### Job Details

Each job listing displays:

- **Company name** and posting source
- **Job title** and location
- **Salary range** (when available)
- **Remote status**
- **Match score** — how well the job aligns with your resume
- **Full description** from the original posting

### Cover Letter Integration

Each job has a cover letter action button that links to the [Cover Letter Generator](/ai-features/cover-letter) with the job description pre-filled via the `?job=ID` parameter.

### Read Tracking

Mark jobs as "read" to keep track of what you've already reviewed. Read status is stored in localStorage per username.

## Usage Guide

1. Navigate to `registry.jsonresume.org/{username}/jobs`
2. Browse the ranked list of jobs — top matches appear first
3. Click on a job to see its full description
4. Use the cover letter button to generate a tailored letter
5. Mark reviewed jobs as read to track your progress
