# Job Swipe

A Tinder-style swiping interface for quickly evaluating matched jobs. Swipe right on jobs you're interested in, left on ones you're not.

## How to Access

- **URL**: `registry.jsonresume.org/pathways/swipe`
- **Auth**: GitHub OAuth login required (feedback is saved)

## Features

### Swipe Interface

Jobs are presented one at a time as cards. Each card shows:

- Company name and job title
- Location and remote status
- Match score
- Key details from the job description

### Swipe Actions

| Action          | Meaning                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Swipe right** | Interested — the job is saved to your feedback |
| **Swipe left**  | Not interested — the job is dismissed          |

### Feedback Persistence

Your swipe decisions are saved and used to:

- Filter already-reviewed jobs from other views
- Inform the [Career Pathways](/ai-features/pathways) copilot about your preferences
- Improve future job recommendations

### Integration with Pathways

Swipe mode is part of the Pathways ecosystem. The AI copilot can reference your swipe history when providing career advice or job recommendations.

1. Navigate to `registry.jsonresume.org/pathways/swipe`
2. Log in with GitHub if prompted
3. Review the job card presented to you
4. Swipe right if interested, left to dismiss
5. Continue through the deck of matched jobs
6. Your feedback is saved automatically
