# Job Tools

JSON Resume's registry includes a suite of job discovery and evaluation tools powered by vector similarity matching and AI analysis. All job data comes from Hacker News "Who is Hiring?" threads, processed with embeddings for semantic matching against your resume.

## Overview

## How Job Matching Works

### Data Pipeline

1. **Collection**: Job posts are scraped from monthly Hacker News "Who is Hiring?" threads
2. **Processing**: Each job post is parsed to extract company, title, location, salary, remote status, and description
3. **Embedding**: Job descriptions are converted to vector embeddings using OpenAI's embedding model
4. **Storage**: Jobs and embeddings are stored in a Supabase database

### Matching Algorithm

When you visit any job tool, your resume is also converted to a vector embedding. Jobs are then ranked by **cosine similarity** between your resume embedding and each job's embedding. Higher similarity scores mean the job description is more semantically aligned with your experience.

### What Gets Matched

The algorithm considers your:

- **Work experience** — Job titles, company types, responsibilities
- **Skills** — Technical skills, tools, frameworks
- **Summary** — Your professional summary and objectives
- **Education** — Relevant educational background
