## Public vs. Authenticated Access

Some analytics features are publicly accessible (anyone can view them for any username), while others require GitHub OAuth login:

- **Public**: ATS Score, Timeline, Explorer, Similarity Graph
- **Authenticated**: Dashboard (accesses private resume data via GitHub)

Public pages show a banner indicating the view mode with a login prompt.
