# Similarity Graph

An interactive force-directed network visualization showing relationships between job positions across the JSON Resume community.

## How to Access

- **URL**: `registry.jsonresume.org/similarity`
- **Auth**: Public (no login required)

## Features

### Position Network

The graph displays positions as nodes connected by similarity:

- **Each node** represents a job position (e.g., "Software Engineer", "Product Manager")
- **Node size** indicates how many resumes contain that position
- **Connections** link positions that frequently appear in similar resumes
- **Clusters** form naturally around related career paths

### Force-Directed Layout

The graph uses a physics-based layout where:

- Connected nodes attract each other
- Unconnected nodes repel each other
- The layout stabilizes into meaningful clusters

### Interaction

| Action           | Effect                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Hover** a node | Highlights the node and all its connections |
| **Click** a node | Opens a list of resumes with that position  |
| **Drag** a node  | Repositions it (other nodes react)          |
| **Scroll**       | Zoom in and out                             |
| **Pan**          | Drag the background to move the view        |

### Visual Encoding

- **Node size**: Number of resumes (larger = more common position)
- **Edge thickness**: Strength of similarity (thicker = more related)
- **Highlighted state**: Shows direct connections when hovering

## Usage Guide

1. Navigate to `registry.jsonresume.org/similarity`
2. Wait for the graph to load and stabilize
3. Zoom out to see the overall structure of career relationships
4. Hover over positions to see their connections
5. Click on a position to find professionals in that role
6. Look for clusters to identify related career paths

## Tips & Best Practices

- Zoom out first to see the big picture, then zoom into areas of interest
- Clusters represent career domains — tech, design, management, etc.
- Use this to discover career transitions others have made
- The data comes from the public JSON Resume community, so coverage varies
