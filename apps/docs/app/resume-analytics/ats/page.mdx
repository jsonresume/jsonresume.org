# ATS Score Analysis

Analyze your resume's compatibility with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) through a two-phase analysis: JSON structure validation and PDF content analysis.

## How to Access

- **URL**: `registry.jsonresume.org/{username}/ats`
- **Auth**: Public (uses your public resume data)

## Features

### Two-Phase Analysis

#### Phase 1: JSON Analysis

Evaluates your structured resume data across multiple categories:

| Category                | What It Checks                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Contact Information** | Email, phone, location, profiles present and valid                       |
| **Work Experience**     | Descriptions quality, date ranges, highlights, quantifiable achievements |
| **Education**           | Institution, degree, dates, completeness                                 |
| **Skills**              | Number of skills, keywords, categorization                               |
| **Summary**             | Length, quality, keyword density                                         |
| **Formatting**          | Consistent date formats, proper structure                                |
| **Completeness**        | All recommended sections present                                         |

#### Phase 2: PDF Analysis

Fetches your rendered PDF resume and analyzes the actual document:

| Check                 | What It Evaluates                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parsability**       | Can ATS systems extract text from the PDF?          |
| **Field Detection**   | Are key fields (name, email, phone) detectable?     |
| **Section Headers**   | Are sections clearly labeled for ATS parsing?       |
| **Keyword Density**   | Are important industry keywords present?            |
| **Formatting Issues** | Tables, images, or layouts that confuse ATS systems |

### Score Breakdown

Each check returns:

- **Score** — Points earned out of maximum
- **Issues** — Specific problems found
- **Passed** — Whether the check met the minimum threshold

The overall ATS score is a weighted aggregate of all checks.

### Recommendations

Each issue comes with an actionable recommendation explaining what to fix and why it matters for ATS compatibility.

## Usage Guide

1. Navigate to `registry.jsonresume.org/{username}/ats`
2. The JSON analysis runs automatically on page load
3. Review each category's score and issues
4. Click on individual issues to see detailed recommendations
5. The PDF analysis runs as a second phase
6. Address high-priority issues first (contact info, work experience)
7. Re-run the analysis after making changes

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint       | Method | Description                   |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------------------------- |
| `/api/ats`     | POST   | Run ATS analysis on a resume  |
| `/api/ats/pdf` | POST   | Run PDF-specific ATS analysis |

**Request body:**

```json
{
  "username": "johndoe"
}
```

## Tips & Best Practices

- Aim for 80+ overall score for good ATS compatibility
- Contact information issues are the highest priority — if ATS can't find your email, your application is lost
- Use specific, quantifiable achievements in work descriptions: _"Increased revenue by 30%"_ scores better than _"Helped with revenue growth"_
- Keep section headers standard: "Work Experience", "Education", "Skills" — avoid creative names
- Fill in all optional sections for a higher completeness score
- Run the analysis after every significant resume update
