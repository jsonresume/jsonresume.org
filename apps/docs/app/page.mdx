# JSON Resume Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for JSON Resume - the open source initiative to create a JSON-based standard for resumes.

## What is JSON Resume?

**JSON Resume is an open-source schema standard for resumes.** At its core, it's just a standardized JSON format for representing your professional history. You can use the schema however you want - with the official tools or with your own custom implementations.

### The Schema (Core)

The JSON Resume schema is an open standard that anyone can use:

- **Standardized Format**: A well-defined JSON schema for resume data
- **Open Specification**: Use it with any tools, frameworks, or platforms
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Your data is portable and tool-agnostic
- **Community-Driven**: Continuously improved by the open-source community

### Official Tools (Optional)

We provide optional reference implementations:

- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for generating and validating resumes
- **Theme System**: Beautiful, customizable themes for rendering resumes
- **Registry**: Hosted platform for publishing and sharing resumes at jsonresume.org
- **Job Board**: AI-powered job board with semantic matching to your resume

**You don't have to use our tools!** The schema is the standard - build your own resume renderer, integrate it into your portfolio site, or use any other tool that supports the JSON Resume format.

## The Standard

JSON Resume follows a standardized schema that makes it easy to represent your professional history in a structured format:

```json
{
  "basics": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "label": "Software Engineer",
    "image": "https://example.com/photo.jpg",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "(912) 555-4321",
    "url": "https://johndoe.com",
    "summary": "A summary of John Doe‚Ä¶",
    "location": {

}
```
