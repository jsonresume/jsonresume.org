# JSON Resume Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for JSON Resume - the open source initiative to create a JSON-based standard for resumes.

## What is JSON Resume?

**JSON Resume is an open-source schema standard for resumes.** At its core, it's just a standardized JSON format for representing your professional history. You can use the schema however you want - with the official tools or with your own custom implementations.

### The Schema (Core)

The JSON Resume schema is an open standard that anyone can use:

- **Standardized Format**: A well-defined JSON schema for resume data
- **Open Specification**: Use it with any tools, frameworks, or platforms
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Your data is portable and tool-agnostic
- **Community-Driven**: Continuously improved by the open-source community

### Official Tools (Optional)

We provide optional reference implementations:

- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for generating and validating resumes
- **Theme System**: 50+ [themes](/themes) for rendering resumes
- **Registry**: Hosted platform for publishing and sharing resumes at jsonresume.org
- **AI Features**: [Career copilot](/ai-features/pathways), [suggestions](/ai-features/suggestions), [cover letters](/ai-features/cover-letter), and [interview simulator](/ai-features/interview)
- **Job Tools**: [Job matching](/job-tools/matching), [graph visualization](/job-tools/graph), and [decision analysis](/job-tools/decisions)
- **Analytics**: [Dashboard](/resume-analytics/dashboard), [ATS scoring](/resume-analytics/ats), and [career timeline](/resume-analytics/timeline)

**You don't have to use our tools!** The schema is the standard - build your own resume renderer, integrate it into your portfolio site, or use any other tool that supports the JSON Resume format.

## The Standard

JSON Resume follows a standardized schema that makes it easy to represent your professional history in a structured format:

```json
{
  "basics": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "label": "Software Engineer",
    "image": "https://example.com/photo.jpg",
    "email": "john@example.com",
