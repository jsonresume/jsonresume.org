# Interview Simulator

## How to Access

- **URL**: `registry.jsonresume.org/{username}/interview`
- **Auth**: Public (uses your public resume data)

## Features

### Two Interview Modes

| Mode                    | You Play        | AI Plays        | Best For                                     |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Candidate** (default) | The candidate   | The interviewer | Practicing answers to common questions       |
| **Interviewer**         | The interviewer | The candidate   | Understanding how to present your experience |

### Resume-Aware Questions

The AI reads your JSON Resume data and generates questions specific to your experience:

- Technical questions based on your listed skills
- Behavioral questions about your work history
- Questions about gaps, transitions, or specific projects
- Follow-up questions that dig deeper into your answers

### Position Toggle

Switch between modes at any time using the toggle at the top of the page. Switching resets the conversation with an appropriate opening message.

## Usage Guide

3. Type your responses in the input field and press Enter
4. The AI will follow up based on your answers
