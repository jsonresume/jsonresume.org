# AI Features

JSON Resume's registry includes a suite of AI-powered tools that help you improve your resume, explore career paths, practice interviews, and generate cover letters — all built on top of your structured JSON Resume data.

## Overview

All AI features are powered by the [Vercel AI SDK v5](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) with OpenAI's GPT-4.1 model. They use your resume as context to provide personalized, relevant assistance.

## Technology Stack

- **AI SDK v5** — Vercel's unified AI SDK for streaming, tool calling, and speech
- **GPT-4.1** — OpenAI's latest model for text generation
- **OpenAI TTS** — Text-to-speech with 6 voice options (alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer)
- **OpenAI Whisper** — Speech-to-text transcription for voice input
- **Streaming responses** — All AI features use streaming for real-time output

## Authentication

Most AI features work with any public JSON Resume and don't require authentication. The **Career Pathways** copilot requires GitHub OAuth login because it can modify and save your resume.

Features that only read your resume data (suggestions, cover letters, interviews, LLM transforms) work by fetching the public resume for any username.

## How It Works

1. Your JSON Resume data is fetched from your GitHub Gist
2. The resume is included as context in the AI system prompt
3. The AI model generates responses personalized to your experience
4. Results are streamed back in real-time
