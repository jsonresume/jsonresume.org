# LLM Transformations

Transform any JSON Resume on-the-fly using natural language prompts via the `?llm=` URL parameter. This feature rewrites the resume content according to your instructions before rendering.

## How to Access

- **URL**: `registry.jsonresume.org/{username}?llm={prompt}`
- **Auth**: Public

## Features

### URL-Based Transformation

Add the `?llm=` query parameter to any resume URL with a natural language prompt. The AI will transform the resume content before rendering it with the selected theme.

### Example Prompts

```
# Translate to French
registry.jsonresume.org/thomasdavis?llm=translate to french

# Make it more concise
registry.jsonresume.org/thomasdavis?llm=make every description more concise

# Tailor for a specific role
registry.jsonresume.org/thomasdavis?llm=tailor this resume for a product manager role

# Change tone
registry.jsonresume.org/thomasdavis?llm=rewrite in a more formal academic tone

# Highlight specific skills
registry.jsonresume.org/thomasdavis?llm=emphasize leadership and management experience
```

### Combining with Themes

You can combine the `?llm=` parameter with `?theme=`:

```
registry.jsonresume.org/thomasdavis?theme=professional&llm=translate to spanish
```

## Usage Guide

1. Start with any resume URL: `registry.jsonresume.org/{username}`
2. Add `?llm=` followed by your transformation prompt
3. The AI processes the resume and returns the transformed version
4. The transformed resume is rendered with the current theme

## How It Works

1. The resume JSON is fetched from the user's GitHub Gist
2. The `?llm=` prompt is sent to GPT-4.1 along with the resume data
3. The AI returns a modified version of the resume JSON
4. The modified JSON is rendered with the selected theme
5. The original resume data is never modified — transformations are read-only

## Tips & Best Practices

- Keep prompts clear and specific for best results
- URL-encode special characters in the prompt (spaces are fine)
- Transformations are not saved — they're generated fresh each time
- Use this to quickly preview how your resume would look tailored for different roles
- Great for creating multiple versions of your resume without editing the source
