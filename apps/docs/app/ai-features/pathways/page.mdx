# Career Pathways

The Career Pathways copilot is an AI-powered career coaching interface that provides real-time conversational guidance while automatically maintaining your resume in JSON Resume format.

## How to Access

- **URL**: `registry.jsonresume.org/pathways`
- **Auth**: GitHub OAuth login required (resume modifications are saved)

## Features

### AI Chat Interface

The copilot uses a split-pane layout with a chat panel on the right and a workspace on the left. You can have natural conversations about your career, and the AI will:

- Provide career advice tailored to your resume
- Answer questions about job markets and career transitions
- Help you articulate your experience and skills

### Tool Calling

The AI can invoke specialized tools during conversation to take actions on your behalf:

| Tool                | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `updateResume`      | Modifies specific sections of your resume (work, education, skills, basics) |
| `filterJobs`        | Filters the job graph by criteria you describe                              |
| `showJobs`          | Focuses the graph on matching jobs                                          |
| `getJobInsights`    | Analyzes job market data relevant to your profile                           |
| `refreshJobMatches` | Updates job recommendations based on resume changes                         |
| `saveJobFeedback`   | Records your feedback on specific jobs                                      |

When the AI calls `updateResume`, changes are applied to your resume in real-time. You can see the changes in the Resume tab and revert if needed.

### Voice Features

Pathways supports both text-to-speech output and voice input:

**Text-to-Speech (Output)**

- Toggle speech on/off with the speaker button
- Choose from 6 OpenAI TTS voices: Alloy, Echo, Fable, Onyx, Nova (default), Shimmer
- AI responses are spoken aloud after streaming completes

**Voice Input**

- Click the microphone button to record a voice message
- Audio is transcribed using OpenAI's Whisper model
- Transcribed text is sent as a chat message

### Workspace Tabs

The left panel has four tabs:

| Tab          | Description                                          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Graph**    | Visual graph of job matches connected to your resume |
| **Feedback** | History of your job feedback and preferences         |
| **Preview**  | Live preview of your resume as rendered HTML         |
| **Resume**   | JSON editor for your resume with syntax highlighting |

### File Upload

Upload an existing resume file (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT) and the AI will extract structured data from it to populate your JSON Resume.

### Session Persistence

Conversations are saved per session. Your resume modifications persist across page reloads as long as you're logged in.

## Usage Guide

1. Navigate to `registry.jsonresume.org/pathways`
2. Log in with GitHub if prompted
3. Start chatting with the AI about your career goals
4. Ask it to update your resume: _"Add my new role as Senior Engineer at Acme Corp"_
5. Switch to the **Preview** tab to see your updated resume
6. Use the **Graph** tab to explore matching jobs
7. Enable voice with the speaker icon for a hands-free experience

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint          | Method | Description                         |
| ----------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `/api/pathways`   | POST   | AI chat streaming with tool support |
| `/api/speech`     | POST   | Text-to-speech generation           |
| `/api/transcribe` | POST   | Voice-to-text transcription         |

## Tips & Best Practices

- Be specific when asking for resume updates: _"Add Python and TypeScript to my skills"_ works better than _"update my skills"_
- Use the Preview tab to verify changes look correct
- The Graph tab updates automatically when your resume changes
- Voice output works best in a quiet environment
- Upload a PDF of your existing resume to quickly populate your JSON Resume
