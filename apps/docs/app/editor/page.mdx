# Resume Editor

A browser-based JSON editor with live validation, syntax highlighting, and direct save to your GitHub Gist. Edit your resume in real-time without leaving the browser.

## How to Access

- **URL**: `registry.jsonresume.org/editor`
- **Auth**: GitHub OAuth login required (saves to your Gist)

## Features

### Monaco Editor

The editor uses [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) (the same editor that powers VS Code) providing:

- **Syntax highlighting** for JSON
- **Auto-completion** for JSON Resume schema fields
- **Error detection** with inline error markers
- **Bracket matching** and auto-closing
- **Find and replace** with regex support
- **Keyboard shortcuts** (Ctrl/Cmd+S to save, etc.)

### Live Validation

Your resume is validated against the JSON Resume schema in real-time:

- Invalid JSON is highlighted with red underlines
- Schema violations are shown as warnings
- Errors appear in the editor's problems panel

### GitHub Gist Integration

The editor saves directly to your GitHub Gist:

- Your existing `resume.json` Gist is loaded on open
- Changes are saved to the same Gist when you save
- The save operation uses the GitHub API via your OAuth token

### Multi-Resume Support

You can maintain multiple resume files in your Gist using the `?gistname=` parameter:

```
registry.jsonresume.org/editor?gistname=resume-en.json
registry.jsonresume.org/editor?gistname=resume-fr.json
registry.jsonresume.org/editor?gistname=resume-short.json
```

This enables maintaining resumes in different languages or different lengths for different purposes.

## Usage Guide

1. Navigate to `registry.jsonresume.org/editor`
2. Log in with GitHub if prompted
3. Your current `resume.json` loads automatically
4. Edit your resume using the Monaco editor
5. Fix any validation errors shown inline
6. Save your changes (they're written to your GitHub Gist)
7. Preview your updated resume at `registry.jsonresume.org/{username}`

## Tips & Best Practices

- Use the schema auto-completion to discover available fields
- Fix validation errors before saving to ensure compatibility
- Use `?gistname=` for maintaining translated versions of your resume
- The editor respects the official [JSON Resume schema](/schema) — refer to the schema docs for field descriptions
