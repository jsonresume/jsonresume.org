# Getting Started

This guide will help you create, validate, and publish your first JSON Resume.

## Two Ways to Use JSON Resume

JSON Resume is **fundamentally just a schema** - a standardized JSON format for resume data. You have two options:

### Option 1: Just Use the Schema

You can use the JSON Resume schema without any of our tools:

- Create a `resume.json` file following the schema
- Build your own resume renderer (website, PDF generator, etc.)
- Validate against the schema manually or with your own tooling
- Host it anywhere (your own server, GitHub, cloud storage)

**This approach gives you complete control.** You own the data and choose how to use it.

### Option 2: Use the Official Tools

We provide optional reference implementations to make it easier:

- **CLI**: For validation, generation, and export
- **Registry**: Host your resume at jsonresume.org
- **Themes**: Pre-built renderers for common formats

**This guide covers Option 2** (using the official tools), but remember - you can always use just the schema if you prefer.

## Installation (Optional Tools)

If you want to use the official tools, here's how to get started.

### Using the Web Registry

The easiest way to get started is to use the web registry at [jsonresume.org](https://jsonresume.org).

1. Visit [jsonresume.org](https://jsonresume.org)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Create a new resume using the web interface
4. Publish your resume to a GitHub Gist

### Using the CLI

For local development, you can install the JSON Resume CLI:

```bash
npm install -g resume-cli
```

## Creating Your First Resume

### 1. Create the JSON File

Create a new file called `resume.json` with your information:

```json
{
  "basics": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "label": "Software Engineer",
    "image": "https://example.com/your-photo.jpg",
    "email": "you@example.com",
    "phone": "(555) 123-4567",
    "url": "https://yourwebsite.com",
    "summary": "A passionate software engineer with expertise in...",
    "location": {
      "city": "San Francisco",
      "countryCode": "US",
      "region": "California"
    },
    "profiles": [
      {
        "network": "GitHub",
        "username": "yourusername",
        "url": "https://github.com/yourusername"
      }
    ]
  },
  "work": [
    {
      "name": "Company Name",
      "position": "Software Engineer",
      "url": "https://company.com",
      "startDate": "2020-01-01",
      "endDate": "2023-12-31",
      "summary": "Worked on building scalable web applications...",
      "highlights": [
        "Built feature X that improved performance by 50%",
        "Led team of 5 engineers"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "education": [
    {
      "institution": "University Name",
      "url": "https://university.edu",
      "area": "Computer Science",
      "studyType": "Bachelor",
      "startDate": "2016-09-01",
      "endDate": "2020-05-01",
      "score": "3.8"
    }
  ],
  "skills": [
    {
      "name": "Web Development",
      "level": "Advanced",
      "keywords": ["JavaScript", "React", "Node.js", "TypeScript"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Validate Your Resume

Use the CLI to validate your resume:

```bash
resume validate resume.json
```

This will check your resume against the JSON Resume schema and report any errors.

## Publishing Your Resume

### Option 1: GitHub Gist (Recommended)

The easiest way to publish your resume is to create a GitHub Gist:

1. Go to [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com)
2. Create a new gist named `resume.json`
3. Paste your resume JSON
4. Make it public
5. Access your resume at: `https://jsonresume.org/[your-github-username]`

### Option 2: Use the Registry

You can also use the registry to publish your resume:

1. Visit [jsonresume.org](https://jsonresume.org)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Upload or paste your resume JSON
4. Publish to make it publicly accessible

## Choosing a Theme

JSON Resume supports multiple themes for rendering your resume. You can preview themes at [jsonresume.org/themes](https://jsonresume.org/themes).

To use a theme with the CLI:

```bash
resume serve --theme [theme-name]
```

Popular themes include:

- `standard` - Clean and professional
- `professional` - Modern and elegant
- `spartacus` - Bold and impactful

## Exporting to PDF or HTML

### Using the CLI

```bash
# Export to HTML
resume export resume.html --theme standard

# Export to PDF
resume export resume.pdf --theme professional
```

### Using the Registry

Visit your resume URL and append the format:

```
https://jsonresume.org/[username].pdf
https://jsonresume.org/[username].html
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have your resume set up, you can:

- Explore the [Job Board](/jobs) to find opportunities matched to your skills
- Learn about the [API](/api) for integrating with other tools
- Check out the [Architecture](/architecture) to understand how JSON Resume works
- [Contribute](/contributing) to the JSON Resume project

## Tips and Best Practices

### Keep It Current

Regularly update your resume JSON as your experience grows. The JSON format makes it easy to version control your resume using Git.

### Use Semantic Versioning

Consider using Git tags to version your resume:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### Validate Often

Always validate your resume after making changes:

```bash
resume validate resume.json
```

### Leverage the Schema

The JSON Resume schema is well-defined. Use an editor with JSON Schema support (like VSCode) for autocomplete and validation as you type.

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid JSON

If you get JSON parsing errors, use a JSON validator like [jsonlint.com](https://jsonlint.com) to find syntax errors.

### Schema Validation Errors

The validator will tell you exactly which fields are missing or invalid. Refer to the [schema documentation](https://jsonresume.org/schema) for field requirements.

### Theme Not Rendering

Make sure the theme is installed:

```bash
npm install jsonresume-theme-[theme-name]
```
