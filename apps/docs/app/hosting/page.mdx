# Hosting & Publishing

This guide covers everything you need to know about hosting and publishing your JSON Resume online.

## Quick Start: Hosting on JSONResume.org

The easiest way to host your resume is through JSONResume.org using GitHub Gist integration.

### Step-by-Step Guide

**1. Create Your Resume JSON**

Create a file named \`resume.json\` with your professional information following the [JSON Resume schema](/schema).

**2. Create a GitHub Gist**

1. Go to [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Create a new gist with the filename \`resume.json\`
4. Paste your resume JSON content
5. Set the gist to **Public** (required for hosting)
6. Click "Create public gist"

**3. Access Your Hosted Resume**

Your resume is now automatically hosted at:

\`\`\`
https://jsonresume.org/[your-github-username]
\`\`\`

For example, if your GitHub username is \`johndoe\`, your resume is at:
\`\`\`
https://jsonresume.org/johndoe
\`\`\`

**That's it!** No signup, no configuration, no deployment steps needed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can I host my resume on JSONResume.org?

**Answer:** Simply create a public GitHub Gist named \`resume.json\` containing your JSON Resume data. The registry automatically detects and renders it at \`https://jsonresume.org/[your-username]\`.

**Requirements:**

- GitHub account
- Public gist named \`resume.json\`
- Valid JSON Resume format

### How long does my resume stay online?

**Answer:** Your resume stays online indefinitely as long as your GitHub Gist remains public. JSONResume.org fetches data directly from your gist in real-time, so there's no separate hosting expiration.

**Persistence:**

- Hosted forever (tied to GitHub Gist lifecycle)
- No renewal or maintenance required
- Automatically updated when you edit your gist

### Can I make my resume private?

**Answer:** Not on the public registry. JSONResume.org requires public gists to render resumes. However, you have alternatives:

**Options for privacy:**

- **Self-host**: Deploy your own instance (see Alternative Hosting Options below)
- **Local rendering**: Use the CLI to generate HTML/PDF locally without publishing
- **Authentication wall**: Build a custom solution with password protection
- **Unlisted gist**: Use an obscure gist filename

### Can I unpublish a resume?

**Answer:** Yes, simply delete or make your GitHub Gist private:

**Method 1: Delete the gist**

1. Go to [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com)
2. Find your \`resume.json\` gist
3. Click "Delete" button
4. Your resume will return 404 within minutes

**Method 2: Make gist private**

1. Edit your gist settings
2. Change visibility to "Secret"
3. Resume becomes inaccessible at jsonresume.org/username

**Note:** Changes may take a few minutes to propagate due to caching.

### Can I host multiple resumes?

**Answer:** Yes! Use the \`?gistname=\` query parameter to host multiple resume versions.

**Example:**
\`\`\`
// Default resume (resume.json)
https://jsonresume.org/johndoe

// English version (resume-en.json)
https://jsonresume.org/johndoe?gistname=resume-en.json

// French version (resume-fr.json)
https://jsonresume.org/johndoe?gistname=resume-fr.json
\`\`\`

### Can I use a custom domain?

**Answer:** Not directly on jsonresume.org, but you can set up a custom domain using redirects or self-hosting.

**Option 1: Domain redirect (easiest)**

Use your domain registrar to set up a 301 redirect to your resume URL.

**Option 2: Self-host with custom domain**

Deploy your own resume renderer to Vercel/Netlify with your custom domain.

### Is hosting on JSONResume.org free?

**Answer:** Yes, completely free!

**What's included:**

- Unlimited resume hosting
- Unlimited traffic
- Multiple themes
- PDF/HTML export
- No ads, no paywalls, no premium tiers

### Does JSONResume.org offer analytics or view counts?

**Answer:** Not currently. JSONResume.org doesn't track views or analytics for privacy reasons.

**Alternatives for tracking:**

- **Self-host with analytics**: Deploy your own version with Google Analytics or Plausible
- **URL shortener**: Use bit.ly or similar to track clicks to your resume URL
- **Custom redirect**: Set up a redirect through your own server to log requests

### How secure is my data on JSONResume.org?

**Answer:** Your data security depends on GitHub's security, not JSONResume.org.

**Security model:**

- **Data storage**: Your resume lives on GitHub Gists (not our servers)
- **Transmission**: HTTPS for all connections
- **Access control**: Managed by GitHub (edit access requires GitHub auth)
- **Caching**: Temporary caching for performance (cleared regularly)

**Best practices:**

- Don't include sensitive data (SSN, full address)
- Use professional email (not personal)
- Remember: public gists are publicly searchable on GitHub

### Can I edit my hosted resume online?

**Answer:** Yes, through GitHub Gist interface.

**How to edit:**

1. Go to [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com)
2. Find your \`resume.json\` gist
3. Click "Edit" button
4. Make changes to JSON
5. Click "Update public gist"
6. Changes appear on jsonresume.org within minutes

### Can I password-protect my hosted resume?

**Answer:** Not on the public JSONResume.org registry.

**Alternatives:**

- **Self-host with authentication**: Deploy your own version with password protection
- **Use unlisted gist filename**: Create a unique filename that's hard to guess
- **Third-party auth services**: Use Netlify Identity or Cloudflare Access

### Can I delete my hosted resume permanently?

**Answer:** Yes, delete your GitHub Gist.

**Permanent deletion steps:**

1. Go to [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com)
2. Open your \`resume.json\` gist
3. Click "Delete" button
4. Confirm deletion

Your resume will return 404 within minutes.

### Can I export a hosted resume back to JSON?

**Answer:** Yes, easily!

**Method 1: Direct JSON endpoint**
\`\`\`
https://jsonresume.org/[username].json
\`\`\`

**Method 2: GitHub Gist raw URL**
Access your gist directly on GitHub and use the raw URL.

### Can I link my hosted resume to LinkedIn or GitHub?

**Answer:** Absolutely! Add your resume URL to your professional profiles.

**LinkedIn:**
Add link in Featured section: \`https://jsonresume.org/yourusername\`

**GitHub:**
Add to profile README:
\`\`\`markdown
[View my resume](https://jsonresume.org/yourusername)
\`\`\`

**Email signature:**
Include your resume URL for easy sharing.
