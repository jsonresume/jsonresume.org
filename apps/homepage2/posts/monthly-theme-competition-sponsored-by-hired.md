JSON Resume helps people create a stylish resume without worrying about design and formatting.

Changing the style of your resume can be done easily in a few seconds because all our themes obey the JSON Resume standard.

Thanks to some talented developers, we already have a variety of great themes. But we would love to see more, so we are announcing a monthly competition with a $250 prize. The winner will be decided by votes.

When we launched JSON Resume, many companies reached out to offer their support. One of these companies, <a href="https://hired.com/?utm_source=sponsor&utm_medium=jsonresume">Hired.com</a>, loved the idea of a portable resume format. We are proud to have them as our sponsors, and believe they are at the frontier of modern hiring practices. They not only allow developers to have more of a say in the hiring process but also dramatically expand the total number of possible opportunities.
